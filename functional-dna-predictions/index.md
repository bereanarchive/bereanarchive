# Functional versus Junk DNA Predictions

<q>The oft-read claim... that the term "junk DNA" never implied developmentally "non-functional DNA" is one that is made either out of ignorance or disingenuousness." — evolutionary biologist Richard Sternberg[^sternberg-2009]</q>

## Overview

Proponents of evolutionary theory predicted that most DNA in organisms with large ++genomes++ and low ++reproductive rates++ would be junk.&nbsp; Meanwhile, ++Intelligent Design++ (ID) proponents predicted that most DNA would turn out to be functional.

This table shows notable scientists who advocated junk DNA and their reasons for doing so.  The placement of X's is conservative, since not every work by each author has been surveyed:

## Proponents of Evolutionary Theory Predicted Junk DNA

There were at least six reasons why proponents of evolutionary theory predicted most DNA in large genomes would be junk, four of which are based on evolutionary theory itself.  In other words, if evolutionary theory is true these are the reasons we should expect that most DNA in large genomes is junk:

### 1. Neutral theory

The neutral theory of evolution claims that most of the DNA differences between larger genome organisms is by chance, and not because natural selection favored organisms having those mutations.  The reasoning is as follows: 

In typical populations of complex organisms, natural selection can only help spread or remove mutations that have a strong effect.&nbsp; Otherwise, random chance is the dominant factor in deciding which organisms reproduce and pass on their genes.

Since most mutations have very little effect on an organism,[^eyre-walker-2007] [^lind-2010] neutral theory is a mathematical reality.[^lynch-2006]  "The revolution is over.  Neutral and nearly neutral theory won," as biologist PZ Myers described.[^myers-2014]

In humans and other large mammals, greater than 99.98% of mutations would spread through the population by chance rather than because of natural selection.[^dodson-1962] [^moran-2014b]

Only about 5 to 10% of DNA is shared between humans and more distantly related mammals such as horses, dogs, and mice.[^meader-2010]&nbsp; Therefore if these animals all evolved from a common ancestor, given neutral theory, the large majority of DNA not shared by these animals would have come about by chance and not natural selection.&nbsp; Since DNA that exists only by chance will have a random sequence, it is therefore highly unlikely to be functional.

### 2. Genetic load

Genetic load (also called mutational load) is the average number of ++deleterious++(harmful) mutations per organism in a population.  If the genetic load is too high, the population will not survive.

Organisms with more DNA generally have more mutations, since the number of errors increases as more is copied.  If most of the DNA in large genome organisms (e.g. mammals) is functional, then these mutations will usually break important functions.  And if evolution could not even maintain these large amounts of DNA, then it could not have created it.

But if most DNA does nothing, or does not have specific information, then most mutations will be harmless.  Therefore because of this genetic load problem, evolutionary theory both predicts and requires only a small amount of DNA in large genome organisms will be functional.

| <img src="/common/img/portraits/motoo-kimura.jpg?w=150">     | **Motoo Kimura**, 1968<br>Biologist who first introduced the neutral theory of evolution.  Assuming a 25-year generation time, his estimate gives 12.5 mutations per generation (25 year generation / 1 mutation / 2 years) and he says such a rate would drive a species extinct:  <blockquote>...in the evolutionary history of mammals, nucleotide substitution has been so fast that, on average, one nucleotide pair has been substituted in the population roughly every 2 years... Calculating the rate of evolution in terms of ++nucleotide substitutions++ seems to give a value so high that many of the mutations involved must be neutral ones...<br/><br/>Haldane's formula shows that if new ++alleles++ produced by nucleotide replacement are substituted in a population at the rate of one substitution every 2 yr, then the substitutional load becomes so large that no mammalian species could tolerate it.&nbsp; Thus the very high rate of nucleotide substitution which I have calculated can only be reconciled with the limit set by the substitutional load by assuming that most mutations produced by nucleotide replacements are almost neutral in natural selection.[^kimura-1968]</blockquote> |

They calculated a mutation rate four times faster than that of Kimura, and likewise concluded 99% of DNA must be junk in order to tolerate this rate:<blockquote>It would appear that mammalian evolution is proceeding at the rate of about two allele substitutions per year.  In relatively long-lived mammals this may be 20 substitutions per species per generation; in the human species this is an evolutionary rate of nearly 60 amino acid substitutions per generation, implying a genome mutation rate including 60 neutral amino acid substitutions per gamete... Either 99 percent of mammalian DNA is not true genetic material, in the sense that it is not capable of transmitting mutational changes, which affect the ++phenotype++, or 40,000 genes is a gross underestimate of the total gene number... it is clear that there cannot be many more than 40,000 genes.[^king-jukes-1969]<br></blockquote> |

If one accepts that the majority of gene substitutions and polymorphisms are selectively neutral, then the restrictions imposed by a genetic load on functional gene number become negligible. Neutral gene substitutions certainly cannot contribute to any accumulating substitutional or mutational load which depends upon selective disadvantage for its action. We must therefore estimate whether the number of functional genes are minimal, or rather that most gene substitutions are inconsequential with respect to natural selection.[^obrien-1973:a]</blockquote><p>In other words, because of genetic load then either the genome must have very few genes, or the genes must be mostly made of junk DNA that can mutate without consequence.

This absurd conclusion was reached through various means [...] only sequences that can be shown to be under selection can be claimed with any degree of confidence to be functional...

### 3. Selfish genes

Some sequences of DNA, called transposons or mobile-elements, have the ability to make copies of themselves within DNA.  Transposons range in size from a few hundred to tens of thousands of letters of DNA.[^britannica-transposon]  The selfish gene theory proposed that among such sequences, those best at copying themselves will produce more copies of themselves than those that copy less frequently.
Most complex organisms have hundreds of millions to billions of letters of DNA. Since having slightly more DNA has a negligible effect on one's ability to survive and reproduce, natural selection does not differentiate between organisms where transposons have produced several more copies.  Since "only very precise deletion can be non-lethal,"[^doolittle-1980] these copying sequences spread much faster than they are removed.  Because of this process, proponents of evolutionary theory proposed that the bulk of large genomes are made up of such selfish genes:

### 4. Trial and Error

Evolution must "try" many useless sequences of DNA before it can find a few successful ones, and these failed remnants will remain genomes because (like selfish genes) selection to remove them is very weak.

Large amounts of junk DNA were also argued for two reasons that do not directly relate to evolutionary theroy:

### 5. The C-value paradox

<a href="/articles/biology/c-value-paradox/"><b>The C-Value Paradox</b></a><br>
Because some organisms have much more DNA than others of similar complexity, it is often argued that most DNA in complex organisms must be junk, and thus they are not designed.  This article argues otherwise.
</div>
</aside>

A C-value is the quantity of all DNA in an organism's ++genome++  Some organisms have genomes much larger or smaller than other organisms of similar complexity, so it was assumed the extra DNA in large genomes wasn't necessary:

### 6. "It seems unused"

Only around 1.5 to 2.9% of the DNA in mammals directly specifies which ++amino acids++ to assemble into ++proteins++  It was assumed that <em>most</em> of the remaining DNA wasn't copied into ++RNA++, and in places where RNA was produced it often didn't do anything.  Some argued (and still argue) that repetitive sequences and ++transposons++ fall into this category:

### Skeletal DNA

However not all proponents of evolutionary theory argued that genomes were mostly junk.  A minority argued that large amounts of DNA were useful as "skeletal DNA"--to increase the size of the cell nucleus as well as spacing between functional regions.  Although being used as spacer is not how most biologists define DNA function.

{[class="quotes"]}

| <img src="/common/img/portraits/thomas-cavalier-smith.jpg?w=150"> | **Thomas Cavalier-Smith**, 1980<blockquote>It seems more reasonable to suppose that large cells actually require more DNA than do small ones... larger cells require more rRNA transport to the ++cytoplasm++ per cell cycle than do smaller cells [...] This could be done by increasing the amount of skeletal DNA so as to increase the nuclear surface area and the number of nuclear pores [...] much of it may be selfish in the restricted sense of having no sequence-specific function.[^cavalier-smith-1980]</blockquote> |

| <img src="/common/img/portraits/john-maynard-smith.jpg?w=150"> | **John Maynard Smith**, 1981<br>Maynard Smith was a well known evolutionary biologist and geneticist.  Science writer Roger Lewin reports on statements from John Maynard Smith at a recent conference:<blockquote>Maynard Smith said that the selfish or ignorant origin of DNA does not necessarily imply that it has no effect on its host. Some sequences might became involved in signaling, and all of them, simply by increasing the amount of DNA in the nucleus, might influence the size and cycle time of the host cells.[^lewin-1981:a]</blockquote> |

### Any Predictions of Function?

Many biologists outside mathematical population genetics didn't like the idea that most DNA was junk.  For example, Thomas Jukes wrote to Francis Crick in 1979:

> I am sure that you realize how frightfully angry a lot of people will be if you say that much of the DNA is junk. The geneticists will be angry because they think that DNA is sacred. The Darwinian evolutionists will be outraged because they believe every change in DNA that is accepted in evolution is necessarily an adaptive change. To suggest anything else is an insult to the sacred memory of Darwin.[^jukes-1979]

In 1981, Roger Lewin reported on the "Genome Evolution and Phenotypic Variation" conference in Cambridge, England.  He highlighted some interesting reports, such as Michael Bennet proposing that the 3D positions of chromosomes would place important functional genes on different chromosomes together.[^lewin-1981:c]  And Roy Britten and Eric Davidson proposing that some DNA between genes had regulatory function.[^lewin-1981:d]  But Lewin's summary doesn't note anyone proposing more than small percentages of function.  He notes:

> The longer biologists searched in vain for functions for these three classes of noncoding DNA, the stronger grew the conviction that much of the DNA might well be "junk" that for some reason could be tolerated in the nuclei of higher organisms.[^lewin-1981:b]

In contrast, in 1994 the Nobel prize winning molecular biology pioneer and physicist Walter Gilbert said:

> I don't believe in junk DNA. I've long believed that the attitude that all information is contained in coding regions is very shortsighted, reflecting a protein chemist's bias of looking at DNA.[^angier-1994]

So it seems that while junk DNA was an unpopular idea, few notable proponents of evolutionary theory argued that anything more than a small percentage of DNA had specific sequence, and none seem to have published journal papers arguing that DNA was at best anything more than skeletal filler or fuel[^angier-1994:a] for evolution.  If it can be shown otherwise this article will be amended.

## ID proponents predicted very little junk DNA

In recent years much more function has been discovered in human DNA.  Genomicist and ++ENCODE++ researcher John Stamatoyannopoulos wrote in 2012, "I don’t think anyone would have anticipated even close to the amount of sequence that ENCODE has uncovered that looks like it has functional importance."[^stamatoyannopoulos-2012  Yet proponents of intelligent design predicted that genomes would contain very little junk DNA long before then:

## How much functional DNA does ID predict?

The [Abundant Functional DNA as Design Evidence](/articles/biology/functional-dna) article defines "strictly" and "loosely" functional DNA.
Under many ID models (especially those that reject common descent) it makes sense for most DNA to be at least loosely functional, and the amount of strictly functional DNA would likely be not far behind.  If evolution primarily degrades function, the percentage of functional DNA depends on how fast and how long it has been degrading.

### The Age of Humans

This table shows the time estimated by various creation and ID groups since humans were created.

{[class="small style1"]}

|Age of Humans|Groups|
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|6,000 (years)|Answers in Genesis, Creation Ministries International, Institute for Creation Research, and most other young earth creation groups.|
|50,000 to 150,000[^reasons-adam]|Reasons to Believe, an old earth creation group|
|2,000,000|Casey Luskin and David Klinghoffer writing for the Discovery Institute[^klinghoffer-2012] (although views within the Discovery Institute vary).|

### A Simple Model

To calculate how much strictly functional human DNA has not already been destroyed, suppose the following:

25 years per human generation.
3 million functional units of 1000 ++nucleotides++ each, making a 3 billion DNA-letter genome.  Humans have two copies of each gene, so alternatively that would make 6 billion if we count both copies of each gene.
50 haploid (affecting one only set of genes) mutations per generation.  The total mutation rate is 100 mutations per generation,[^moran-2013] so we divide that by two.
45 haploid mutations that persist from one generationto the next, assuming 5 are removed by natural selection.[^gibson-2011]
A 10% chance a mutation within a gene will destroy that gene.  Many mutations are neutral--having no effect on function, and others only slightly degrade the function of a gene.
Most mutations are either neutral or only slightly ++deleterious++,[^eyre-walker-2007] [^lind-2010] causing genes to slowly degrade across the entire population.  Then when a gene becomes entirely non-functional, selection is largely blind to the difference between it and a hightly degraded version of the same gene.

Multiplying the 45 haploid mutations times the 10% chance a mutaiton will destroy a gene gives 4.5 genes being destroyed each generation.  From there we can extrapolate:

{[class="small style1"]}

|Age of Humans|Generations|Genes destroyed|Functional haploid genome|Functional diploid genome|
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|6,000 (years)|240|1,080|99.96%|99.999984%|
|10,000|400|1,800|99.94%|99.999964%|
|100,000|4,000|18,000|99.4%|99.9964%|
|1,000,000|40,000|180,000|94%|99.64%|
|6,000,000|240,000|1,080,000|66.67%|88.89%|The "functional diploid genome" column shows the odds of having both pairs in a set of genes broken.  If one among a pair of a genes is still functional, the gene is considered functional.

### Caveats with These Models

The results become more skewed further into the past, since when only 66% of the genome is functional, the deleterious mutation rate is reducted to 50 times 66%.
Genes work together in complex, interacting networks.  Knocking out one pair of genes could make the entire network non-functional.  Conversely, unrelated genes may kick in to perform the same task as other genes that have failed.  This model accounts for neither phenomenon.


### Other Models

Botanist Alex Williams makes a more pessimistic estimate in a 2008 Journal of Creation article.  Based on estimated rates of gene loss and the percentage of critical genes, Williams calculates between 1200 and 1.5 million until humans accumulate too many mutations to survive.[^williams-2008]
However, a less-involved form of design could give very different predictions.  Perhaps a designer only seeded the first cells on earth, or that chemistry itself was designed to greatly increase the odds of life forming from non-living matter.  And then unguided evolution proceeded from there to create most of the life forms we see today.  If a designer only played such a modest role, then the bulk of larger genomes could be junk.

## Perspectives change

As new research revealed higher-than-expected levels of function, some former junk DNA proponents changed their minds:

Other functional genome researchers expect even more functions to be found in the future:

Although others (including many of the junk DNA proponents quoted above) still maintain that the large majoirty of human DNA is non-functional.

It appears there are also long 'spacer' segments of DNA that lie between genes and that don't crowd for protein.   In some instances, these regions extend across hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs, in which case they are referred to rather dismissively as 'gene deserts.'  These regions are not just filler, however.  They contain many of the signals that are needed to instruct a nearby gene about whether it should be on or off at a given developmental time in a given tissue.  Furthermore, we are learning that there may be thousands of genes hanging out in these so-called deserts that don't code for protein at all.  They are copied into RNA, but those RNA molecules are never ++translated++--instead, they serve some other important function."</small>

Sandwalk Blog.  2014.  <small>Joe Felsenstein is a well known population geneticist who has published a [criticism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2459384?seq=1) of Haldane's limit.  When he and biochemist Larry Moran (both Intelligent Design critics) were asked to estimate the number of beneficial versus netural differences between human and chimps, they replied, "Updated numbers suggest 44 million point mutations and something like 2 million insertions/deletions for a grand total of 46 million mutations. We don't know how many of those were beneficial (adaptive) leading to ways in which modern chimps are better adapted than the common ancestor.  (Same for humans.) My guess would be only a few thousand in each lineage.  1 - 3000 / 23,000,000 is **99.987%** of fixed mutations being neutral.</small>
