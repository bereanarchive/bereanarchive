<h1>Predictions of Junk versus Functional DNA</h1>
<p><q>
	"As someone who has studied the concept of 'junk DNA' for over twenty years, I am dismayed by
	two statements that appear repeatedly on various blog sites discussing evolution: 'No one ever
	asserted that junk DNA is without function...it was long suspected that these sequences have
	important roles in the cells.'" — evolutionary biologist Richard Sternberg[^sternberg-2009]</q></p>
<p><q>"I have noticed that there are some creationists who are jumping on [the 2012
	<dfn>ENCODE</dfn> results] because they think that's awkward for Darwinism.&nbsp; Quite the
	contrary.&nbsp; It's exactly what a Darwinist would hope for, is to find usefulness in the
	living world." — Richard Dawkins[^dawkins-jonathan-sacks]</q></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Proponents of evolutionary theory predicted that most DNA in organisms with large
	<dfn>genomes</dfn> and low <dfn>reproductive rates</dfn> would be junk.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
	<dfn>Intelligent Design</dfn> (ID) proponents predicted that most DNA would turn out to
	be functional.</p>
<p>This table shows notable scientists who advocated junk DNA and their reasons for doing so. The
	placement of X's is conservative, since not every work by each author has been surveyed:</p>

<p>The following describes the fascinating history of this debate. </p>
<h2>Proponents of Evolutionary Theory Predicted Junk DNA</h2>
<p>There were at least six reasons why proponents of evolutionary theory predicted most DNA in
	large genomes would be junk, four of which are based on evolutionary theory itself.&nbsp; In
	other words, if evolutionary theory is true these are the reasons we should expect that most DNA
	in large genomes is junk:</p>
<h3>1. Neutral theory</h3>
<p>The neutral theory of evolution claims that most of the DNA differences between larger genome
	organisms is by chance, and not because natural selection favored organisms having those
	mutations.&nbsp; The reasoning is as follows:&nbsp; </p>
<ol>
	<li><span>In typical populations of complex organisms, natural selection can only help spread
		or remove mutations that have a strong effect.&nbsp; Otherwise, random chance is the
		dominant factor in deciding which organisms reproduce and pass on their genes.</span></li>
	<li>Since most mutations have very little effect on an organism,[^eyre-walker-2007] [^lind-2010] neutral theory is a
		mathematical reality.[^lynch-2006]"[T]he revolution is over. Neutral and nearly neutral theory
		won,"as biologist PZ Myers described.[^myers-2014]
	</li>
</ol>
<p>In humans and other large mammals, greater than 99.98% of mutations would spread through the
	population by chance rather than because of natural selection.[^dodson-1962] [^moran-2014b]
	</p>
<p>Only about 5 to 10% of DNA is shared between humans and more distantly related mammals such as
	horses, dogs, and mice.[^meader-2010]&nbsp; Therefore if these animals all evolved from a
	common ancestor, given neutral theory, the large majority of DNA not shared by these animals
	would have come about by chance and not natural selection.&nbsp; Since DNA that exists only
	by chance will have a random sequence, it is therefore highly unlikely to be functional.

<h3>2. Genetic load</h3>
<p>Genetic load (also called mutational load) is the average number of <dfn>deleterious</dfn>
	(harmful) mutations per organism in a population.&nbsp; If the genetic load is too high, the
	population will not survive.<br></p>
<p>Organisms with more DNA genreally have more mutations, since the number of errors increases as
	more is copied.&nbsp; If most of the DNA in large genome organisms (e.g. mammals) is functional,
	then these mutations will usually break important functions.&nbsp; And if evolution could not
	even maintain these large amounts of DNA, then it could not have created it.</p>
<p>But if most DNA does nothing, or does not have specific information, then most mutations will be
	harmless.&nbsp; Therefore because of this genetic load problem, evolutionary theory both
	predicts and requires only a small amount of DNA in large genome organisms will be functional.

<h3>3. Selfish genes</h3>
<p>Some sequences of DNA, called transposons or mobile-elements, have the ability to make copies of
	themselves within DNA.&nbsp; Transposons range in size from a few hundred to tens of
	thousands of letters of DNA.[^britannica-transposon]&nbsp; The selfish
	gene theory proposed that among such sequences, those best at copying themselves will
	produce more copies of themselves than those that copy less frequently.</p>
<p>Most complex organisms have hundreds of millions to billions of letters of DNA. Since having
	slightly more DNA has a negligible effect on one's ability to survive and reproduce, natural
	selection does not differentiate between organisms where transposons have produced several more
	copies.&nbsp; Since "only very precise deletion can be non-lethal,"[^doolittle-1980] these
	copying sequences spread much faster than they are removed.&nbsp; Because of this process,
	proponents of evolutionary theory proposed that the bulk of large genomes are made up of such

<p>Under many ID models (especially those that reject common descent) it makes sense for most DNA
	to be at least loosely functional, and the amount of strictly functional DNA would

<ol>
	<li>25 years per human generation.</li>
	<li>3 million functional units of 1000 <dfn>nucleotides</dfn> each, making a 3 billion
		DNA-letter genome.&nbsp; Humans have two copies of each gene, so alternatively that would
		make 6 billion if we count both copies of each gene.</li>
	<li>50 haploid (affecting one only set of genes) mutations per generation.&nbsp; The total
		mutation rate is 100 mutations per generation,<span>[^moran-2013] so we divide
		that by two.</span></li>
	<li>45 haploid mutations that persist from one generationto the next, assuming 5 are removed by
		natural selection.[^gibson-2011]</li>
	<li>A 10% chance a mutation within a gene will destroy that gene.&nbsp; Many mutations are
		neutral--having no effect on function, and others only slightly degrade the function of a
		gene.</li>
	<li>Most mutations are either neutral or only slightly
		<dfn>deleterious</dfn>,[^eyre-walker-2007] [^lind-2010] causing genes
		to slowly degrade across the entire population.&nbsp; Then when a gene becomes entirely
		non-functional, selection is largely blind to the difference between it and a hightly
		degraded version of the same gene.</li>
</ol>
<p>Multiplying the 45 haploid mutations times the 10% chance a mutaiton will destroy a gene gives
	4.5 genes being destroyed each generation.&nbsp; From there we can extrapolate:<br></p>

<p>The "functional diploid genome" column shows the odds of having both pairs in a set of genes
	broken.&nbsp; If one among a pair of a genes is still functional, the gene is considered
	functional.</p>
<h3>Caveats with These Models</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The results become more skewed further into the past, since when only 66% of the genome is
		functional, the deleterious mutation rate is reducted to 50 times 66%.</li>
	<li>Genes work together in complex, interacting networks.&nbsp; Knocking out one pair of genes
		could make the entire network non-functional.&nbsp; Conversely, unrelated genes may kick in
		to perform the same task as other genes that have failed.&nbsp; This model accounts for
		neither phenomenon.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Models</h3>
<p>Botanist Alex Williams makes a more pessimistic
	estimate in a 2008 Journal of Creation article.&nbsp; Based on estimated rates of gene loss and the percentage of critical
	genes, Williams calculates between 1200 and 1.5 million until humans accumulate too
	many mutations to survive.[^williams-2008]</p>
<p>However, a less-involved form of design could give very different predictions. Perhaps a
	designer only seeded the first cells on earth, or that chemistry itself was designed to greatly
	increase the odds of life forming from non-living matter?&nbsp; And then unguided evolution
	proceeded from there to create most of the life forms we see today.&nbsp; If a designer only
	played such a modest role, then the bulk of larger genomes could be junk.</p>
<h2>Perspectives change</h2>
<p>As new research revealed higher-than-expected levels of function, some former junk DNA
	proponents changed their minds:</p>

<p>Richard Dawkins' own selfish gene theory led to the expectation that most of the human genome
	was junk,<span>[^dawkins-1976] [^doolittle-1980] [^avise-2010]
	[^graur-2012]</span> while neutral theory and the problem of genetic load require it
	outright.&nbsp; So it doesn't make sense for Dawkins to say "it's exactly what a Darwinist would
	hope for."</p>
<p>Even shortly before the landmark ENCODE phase 2 announcement of 80% function in
	2012, biochemist and junk DNA proponent Larry Moran blogged that most evolutionary
	biologists he meets no longer share his view:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>In my opinion, the evidence for massive amounts of junk DNA in our genome is overwhelming
		but I struggle to convince other scientists of this ... I recently attended a meeting of
		evolutionary biologists and I'm pretty sure that the majority still don't feel very
		comfortable with the idea that 90% of our genome is junk.[^moran-2012]</p>

			&nbsp;"The <dfn>exons</dfn> and <dfn>introns</dfn> of protein-coding genes add up together to about 30 percent
			of the genome. Of that 30 percent, 1.5 percent are coding exons and 28.5 percent are
			removable introns. What about the rest? It appears there are also long 'spacer' segments
			of DNA that lie between genes and that don't crowd for protein. In some instances, these
			regions extend across hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs, in which
			case they are referred to rather dismissively as 'gene deserts.' These regions are not
			just filler, however. They contain many of the signals that are needed to instruct a
			nearby gene about whether it should be on or off at a given developmental time in a
			given tissue. Furthermore, we are learning that there may be thousands of genes hanging
			out in these so-called deserts that don't code for protein at all. They are copied into
			RNA, but those RNA molecules are never <dfn>translated</dfn>--instead, they serve some other
			important function."<br>Mirrors:
