<h1>Organisms Appear Designed</h1>

<q>"Technology when sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from biology."</q>
<p>Biologists and those in related fields usually agree organisms are very complex
	and intuitively appear designed, even among those (the majoirty) who reject
	design in favor of evolutionary causes.
	<b> This alone does not prove organisms were designed.&nbsp; </b>But
	it adds weight to the other more quantitive arguments favoring design over evolutionary
	theory.
</p>
<h2>Affirming the appearance of design</h2>
<p>This list includes who are neutral or hostile to intelligent design still agree
	that life has the appearance of being very well designed, even though they
	believe it was not:</p>

<p>Above, Richard Dawkins clarifies that he is only talking about the illusion
	of design.&nbsp; He believes that evolution is an adequate mechanism to account
	for it, and bad designs exist in biology that are contrary to what a designer would
	create.&nbsp; Many others in this list would agree.&nbsp; But if those claims can
	be shown meritless (as other articles on the Berean Archive argue) then we're left
	with the appearance of design and no other explanation for it.</p>
