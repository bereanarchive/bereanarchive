# Transgenderism

## Summary

Male and female bodies differ not just in sex chromosomes and reproductive organs, but also on average in size, shape, bone length and density, fat distribution, musculature, and in various organs, especially the brain.  This leads to differences in how men and women experience emotion and pain, how they see and hear, and how they remember and navigate.  

The trans movement seeks to have gender dysphoric people believe they're trapped in the wrong body, sets up a false self-image as they pretend to be someone they're not, and ignore the many resulting comorbidities.  We instead need to help people love themselves for who they are.

Meanwhile, the transgender political movement seeks to redefine public life such that previously male/female divisions adhere to a person's gender identity rather than their actual sex.  Yet subjective feelings, no matter how strong, cannot transform reality.

## Types and their Causes

### Biological

Anderson:  Mayer and McHugh concluded that "almost nothing is well understood" about how biology might cause the sense of having a gender at odds with one's biological sex.

Zucker:

> biological factors (e.g., possible genetic factors, prenatal sex hormones, temperament) are conceptualized as possible predisposing factors for the expression of a particular gender identity phenotype. They are not conceptualized as fixed factors leading to invariant gender identity differentiation across developmental time.[^zucker-2012]

#### Genetic

> Dunne, and Martin (2000) also measured childhood gender nonconformity of the twins in their study and found that heritability accounted for 50% of variance in recalled childhood gender nonconformity among men. Monozygotic twins who are both gay were more similar in their cross-gender behavior (correlation of gender nonconformity = .54) compared to dizygotic twins who are both gay (correlation of gender nonconformity = .14). Similar results were obtained by Alonko et al. (2010) in a study of Finnish twins taken from a national register: monozygotic (male) twins had higher correlations on both gender atypical behavior and sexual orientation (r = .56 and .50, respectively) compared to dizygotic twins (r = .27 and .25, respectively). These finding suggested that childhood gender nonconformity, like homosexuality, is heritable. In fact, a study of Dutch children taken from a national twin register, and who were therefore unselected for gender identity or sexual orientation, estimated that 70% of the variance in cross-gender behavior was accounted for by genetic factors (van Beijsterveldt, Huzdiak, & Boomsma, 2006). Alonko et al. (2010) found a large genetic correlation (r = .73) between gender atypical behavior and sexual orientation for the male twin pairs, which suggests that a shared set of genes is partially responsible for both childhood gender nonconformity and adult homosexuality.   [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

#### Anticonvulsant?

"higher numbers of prenatally anticonvulsant-exposed subjects reported current or past cross-gender behavior and/or gender dysphoria.  Three prenatally anticonvulsant-exposed subjects were transsexuals and had undergone sex reassignment surgery, a remarkably high rate given the rarity of transsexualism. In addition, two exposed males had exclusively homosexual experiences, whereas none of the control males reported exclusive homosexual behavior."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10097803

#### Hormonal

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

> Research on biological females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) provides evidence for the influence of prenatal hormones on sex-typed behaviors. In CAH, a defect in the enzyme involved in cortisol production results in the adrenal glands producing higher than normal levels of androgens.  As the condition is recognized at birth and corrected, the period of abnormal androgen exposure is generally limited to the prenatal period.  Data from several groups of researchers consistently show that girls with CAH show a male-typical pattern of toy and activity preferences from childhood through adulthood... they are, on average, more active and aggressive than girls without CAH...  Girls with CAH also appear to have an enhanced preference for boys as playmates... and engage in more rough-and-tumble play compared to unaffected girls... The extent of male-typed interests in childhood in females with CAH appears to be correlated with the degree of prenatal androgen exposure.
>
> In adulthood, women with CAH have a higher rate of bisexuality/homosexuality compared to unaffected women... Women with CAH also report unhappiness with their female gender role and gender identity.  In a review of the literature on women with CAH (total n = 250)13, Dessens, Slijper, & Drop (2005) estimated that approximately 5% experienced gender dysphoria and 1.6% pursued a gender transition (see also for a review, Hines, 2010). These percentages are significantly higher than the estimated prevalence rate of FtM transsexualism in the general population of biological females (1:30,400).  Based on their review, women with CAH were approximately 500 times more likely than women in the general population to experience severe gender dysphoria and transition to the male gender role. It has been argued that the excessive androgen exposure in women with CAH is the linkage factor that explains the behavioral masculinity in childhood and gender dysphoria and bisexuality/homosexuality in adulthood.  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

> Most boys and adults with GID have normally developed genitalia (Green, 1976). Thus, if prenatal androgen levels are implicated in the etiology of GID, the effects are such that genital development is not affected in any obvious way. Animal studies have shown that there are different sensitive periods for prenatal androgen effects on behavior and genital anatomy. For example, in female rhesus macaques, Goy, Bercovitch, and McBrair (1988) were able to induce behavioral masculinization without accompanying genital ambiguity (i.e., the genitals were not masculinized) by altering the timing of prenatal androgen exposure. These results suggest that, depending on the timing of prenatal exposure to androgens, there may be subsequent effects on behavior, anatomy or both.  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

Biochemist Neil Whitehead, in the conservative Journal of Human Sexuality:

> Homosexuality and transgender orientations have been assumed to be due to prenatal disturbances in testosterone hormone exposure, but the Lombardo et al. result for heterosexuality implies that prenatal influence is at best weak to modest for homosexuality and transgender. The fact that research is increasingly revealing multiple influences makes parenting important and sexual therapy a possibility.  https://www.journalofhumansexuality.com/_files/ugd/ec16e9_ca58580f61d84028b1a92e0f7499a310.pdf

#### T. Gondii?

toxoplasma gondii (probably not but might be worth looking into):
"In a follow-up study of seven adult patients with congenital toxoplasmosis, one male patient had developed a male-to-female GID [gender identity disorder] and undergone gender-reassignment surgery. It is therefore possible that Toxoplasma infection may be a common risk factor for both disorders, though this proposal needs to be tested serologically in individuals with GID. "

John Brisson:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11994495/
"Phenobarbital creates a dominance Th2 system, that over time allows parasites like T. Gondii to go undetected during autoimmunity"

Treatment with pimozide [antipsychotic drug] reversed transgenderism in one person:
"The successful treatment of a gender dysphoric patient with pimozide."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8839957/
John Brisson:  When asked if pimozide is an anti-parasitic "As a piperidine yes it would. Piperizine is used in fyg to tackle parasites"

Counterargument about pimozide:
https://genderanalysis.net/2016/12/myth-pimozide-and-gender-dysphoria-gender-analysis/

Summary:

I often fear the current political climate of seeing transgenderism as an identity instead of a delusion is harming trans-gendered people, by affirming their delusion instead of treating underlying causes.

One idea that I find interesting is that some transgenderism may be caused by T. Gondii, a parasite known to cause dramatic behavioral changes in other mammals.

This report suggests transgenderism may be caused by toxoplasm gondi, based on one of their seven subjects becoming transgender[1]. This report[2] noted that treatment with pimozide (an antipsychotic and anti-parasitc against T. Gondii) reversed transgenderism in one patient, which returned when dosage was reduced and disappeared again when dosage was increased. Likewise, these researchers note that prenatal exposure to phenobarbital is correlated with transgenderism.[3] Phenobarbital creates a dominance Th2 system, that over time allows parasites like T. Gondii to go undetected during autoimmunity.

But these are very small sample-size studies and need to be tested on a larger scale.

#### Brain Scans

> Anderson:  Mayer and McHugh found that the gender identity studies focusing on the brain "have demonstrated weak correlations between brain structure and cross-gender identification." And the correlations that show up "do not provide any evidence for a neurobiological basis for cross-gender identification. " One problem with the existing studies is that their sample sizes are small, nonrandom, and non-representative. Moreover, their conclusions are often "conflicting and confusing."  

Bailey:  Studies showing brain differences are highly popular and widely cited, but didn't control for transgenders altering their brains by taking hormones:

> In 1995, Zhou et al. described a sex difference in the size of a brain region, the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a collection of cells in the hypothalamus. This article included data from the brains of six MtF transsexuals, whose BSTc volumes were female-typical. A follow-up paper by Kruijver et al. (2000) added another MtF transsexual's brain and conﬁrmed the earlier ﬁnding using different measurement techniques.  
>
> These studies have been widely touted by transsexual activists as supporting the brain-sex theory of MtF transsexualism.  Furthermore, a remarkable statement by the British group, the Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES 2006), appeared to base its support of transsexual treatment and rights largely on the studies and their alleged implication that "transsexualism is a neuro-developmental condition of the brain." Several of the signatories of this statement are distinguished researchers. The transsexual brain studies have also received considerable scientiﬁc attention. As of February 1, 2007, the study by Zhou et al. (1995) has been cited by 117 scholarly articles, and that of Kruijver et al. (2000) has been cited by 43 scholarly articles. In contrast, Blanchard's three most highly cited autogynephilia-related studies (Blanchard 1985, 1989b; Blanchard, Clemmensen, and Steiner 1987) have each earned 38 such citations.
>
> [...]
>
> The most critical problem is that neither study includes the necessary hormonal controls to exclude the possibility that the feminization of the BSTc in MtFs was due to hormone treatment, especially estrogen therapy, received for transsexualism. Recent research shows that the volume of the hypothalamus is highly dependent on such hormonal treatment, with smaller volumes associated with estrogenic treatment (Hulshoff Pol et al. 2006). We concur with Lawrence (2007b) that this is the most likely explanation of the Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000) ﬁndings.  [Bailey 2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5893630_What_Many_Transgender_Activists_Don't_Want_You_to_Know_and_why_you_should_know_it_anyway)

#### Twin Studies

20% of identical twins where one is transgender, both are transgender

> Combining data from the present survey with those from past-published reports, 20% of all male and female monozygotic twin pairs were found concordant for transsexual identity. 

If it was genetic or pre-natal hormones we'd expect this to be 100%.

### Psychological

Also see Littman 2018 below.

> children with GID display significantly more behavior problems compared to their siblings and non-referred children but typically display as many behavior problems as other clinical populations, with older children with GID having more behavior problems than younger children.  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

> Wallien et al. compared 120 children referred to a specialized gender identity clinic and diagnosed with GID (86 boys, 34 girls; age range, 4-11 years) to 47 children 55 (37 boys, 10 girls) referred to an ADHD clinic and who served as a clinical control group. Of the 120 children with GID, 62 (51.6%) met criteria for a DSM diagnosis other than GID. There was no significant difference between the GID and ADHD children on number and type of comorbid diagnoses. Of the 86 GID boys, 48 (55.8%) met criteria for a diagnosis other than GID.  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

But what's cause and what's effect?  Littman 2018 showed mental health issues preceded ROGD teens.

#### Trauma

The APA denies that they're caused by adverse childhood events.

> dissemination of inaccurate information about the effects of SOCE or about sexual orientation, such as the discredited idea that same-gender orientations are caused by negative childhood events or family dysfunction (Flentje et al., 2013; Shidlo & Gonsiorek, 2017). 

#### Other Disorders

> some children with GID may have comorbid Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), particularly Asperger’s Disorder (e.g., de Vries, Noens, Cohen-Kettenis, van Berckelaer-Onnes, & Doreleijers, 2010; Landén & Rasmussen, 1997; Mukkades, 2002; Zucker et al., 2012b). One explanation for a possible linkage between these two relatively rare disorders is the intense focus/obsessional interest in specific activities (e.g., Klin, Danovitch, Merz, & Volkmar, 2007). Postema et al. (2011) examined two 52 items on the CBCL [Child Behavior CheckList] which measure obsessions... These preliminary results support the idea that boys with GID (and, generally, children with GID) show an apparent elevation in obsessional interests, which may be one reason for the observed comorbidity of GID and PDD.  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

Separation Anxiety:

> Boys with GID typically present with more internalizing than externalizing difficulties, such as separation anxiety.  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

> A "significant association" was found by Zucker when mothers answered "Yes" or "sometimes" in at least three out of nine categories when testing for separation anxiety disorder (SAD)  Of the 73 boys who meet full criteria for GID, 47 (64.4%) also met the criteria for SAD. In contrast, only 16 (38.1%) of the 42 boys who were subthreshold for the diagnosis of GID also met criteria for SAD. [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

Lacking friends:

> The role of peer relations in the lives of children with GID is emphasized by the fact that, for some clinicians, a primary goal of treatment for gender- 53 referred children is to prevent social ostracism and improve peer relations.  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

#### Similarities to other Dysphorias

McHugh:

> In standard medical and psychological practice, a child who has a persistent, mistaken belief that is inconsistent with reality is not encouraged in his or her belief.  For instance, an anorexic child is not encouraged to lose weight. She is not treated with liposuction; instead, she is encouraged to align her belief with reality – i.e., to see herself as she really is. Indeed, this approach is not just a good guide to sound medical practice. It is common sense... Until recently this was precisely how gender dysphoric children were treated.[^mchugh-2017]



> a girl with anorexia nervosa has the persistent mistaken belief that she is obese; a person with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) harbors the erroneous conviction that she is ugly; a person with body integrity identity disorder (BIID) identifies as a disabled person and feels trapped in a fully functional body. Individuals With BIID are often so distressed by their fully capable bodies that they seek surgical amputation of healthy limbs or the surgical severing of their spinal cord. Dr. Anne Lawrence, who is transgender, has argued that BIID has many parallels with GD [gender dysphoria]. -- Ryan T. Anderson, page 110ish

Affirming a person with Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID):

> Consider what would be involved in medically "affirming" the false assumptions instead: for example, performing a requested amputation on a person with body integrity Identity disorder. This might alleviate the emotional distress, for a while, but would do nothing to resolve the underlying psychological problem, and it might lead to the person's death. -- Ryan T. Anderson, page 111ish.

McHugh

> In fact, gender dysphoria—the official psychiatric term for feeling oneself to be of the opposite sex—belongs in the family of similarly disordered assumptions about the body, such as anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder. Its treatment should not be directed at the body as with surgery and hormones any more than one treats obesity-fearing anorexic patients with liposuction. The treatment should strive to correct the false, problematic nature of the assumption and to resolve the psychosocial conflicts provoking it. With youngsters, this is best done in family therapy.  https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/06/15145/

CMI, http://creation.com/transsexuals-gospel

> "As Christians, we believe that our feelings are not a fundamentally trustworthy measure of what is true, or of what is good for us. As an analogy, there are people with anorexia who are convinced that they are fat. When they look in the mirror, they see themselves as grossly obese, when in reality their ribs may be poking out and they are dangerously underweight. We offer these individuals compassionate counseling with the goal of restoring a self-image that is in line with reality, for both their physical and mental health... But when a boy looks in the mirror and sees a girl, and thinks he is a girl, and should dress and socialize as such, society is now entering into a charade where we reinforce this objectively false belief, to the extent that we will amputate perfectly healthy body parts and pump him full of female hormones to make his body fit this false perception. But this would be akin to offering gastric bypass surgery to anorexics. And it doesn’t change the fundamental, genetic, and biological fact that he is a boy."

#### Parent's poor mental health

But low p-values:
"In addition, crossgender behavior did not appear to be related to parental psychiatric problems
(mother p = 0.93; fathers p = 0.59), family problems during childhood (p = 0.22), and SES (p = 0.89)"
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peggy_Cohen-Kettenis/publication/13193013_Prenatal_Exposure_to_Anticonvulsants_and_Psychosexual_Development/links/56d1a8ed08ae059e375f77d3/Prenatal-Exposure-to-Anticonvulsants-and-Psychosexual-Development.pdf

> It has been shown that behavior problems in gender-referred children may be significantly associated with measures of parental psychopathology and this may reflect generic familial vulnerability to psychopathology (Zucker & Bradley, 1995; Zucker et al., 2003).  Third, associated psychopathology in children with GID may be implicated in the etiology of GID and, therefore, may contribute to its genesis (Coates & Person, 1985; Zucker et al., 2012b).   [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

#### Misc

> “…people with gender dysphoria, especially young people, have a high incidence of concomitant psychiatric diagnoses, self-harming behavior or suicide attempts compared with the rest of the population.
>
> The diagnoses that stand out are depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD and autism. In the group of 13–17-year-olds who were registered as girls at birth and who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the comorbidity is greatest.”
>
> Of these, had:

> - 28.9 percent some form of depressive disorder
> - 19.4 percent adhd
> - 15.2 percent autism

### Male Prisoners

McHugh:

> One group includes male prisoners like Pvt. Bradley Manning, the convicted national-security leaker who now wishes to be called Chelsea. Facing long sentences and the rigors of a men's prison, they have an obvious motive for wanting to change their sex and hence their prison.[^mchugh-2016]

### Sexually aroused men

McHugh in First Things:

> Most of the cases fell into one of two quite different groups. One group consisted of conflicted and guilt-ridden homosexual men who saw a sex-change as a way to resolve their conflicts over homosexuality by allowing them to behave sexually as females with men. The other group, mostly older men, consisted of heterosexual (and some bisexual) males who found intense sexual arousal in cross-dressing as females.  https://www.firstthings.com/article/2004/11/surgical-sex

Sexual arousal, AKA Blanchard's Theory

> Ray Blanchard has shown that there are two distinct subtypes of MtF transsexuals. Members of one subtype, homosexual transsexuals, are best understood as a type of homosexual male. The other subtype, autogynephilic transsexuals, are motivated by the erotic desire to become women.
>
> [...]
>
> That is, autogynephilic males are like heterosexual men, except that their primary sexual attraction is to the image or idea of themselves as women
>
> https://muse.jhu.edu/article/222232/pdf

Blanchard's theory (sexual attraction) proponents still support surgery:

> Perhaps most importantly, both proponents of the feminine essence narrative and of Blanchard's theory support the treatment of transsexuals by sex reassignment surgery. Indeed, Blanchard (2000) has been a consistent advocate of such treatment for both homosexual and autogynephilic transsexuals, as has one of the authors of this article (Bailey 2003) [Bailey 2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5893630_What_Many_Transgender_Activists_Don't_Want_You_to_Know_and_why_you_should_know_it_anyway)

Reasons why autogynephilia is unpopular:

> the concern (pre-transition) that clinicians will deem them unacceptable for sex reassignment if their transsexualism is erotically motivated, or that people will consider them sexually deviant (Bailey 2003; Lawrence 2004). Because autogynephilia produces a strong desire to imagine oneself as a woman, the feminine essence narrative is intrinsically appealing to autogynephilic individuals, even if it is implausible. In contrast, an explanation based on autogynephilia may be experienced as a narcissistic injury... MtF transition sometimes see themselves as mentors to younger people attempting or considering this path.... parents may be more accepting era child whom they think of as a female unfortunately born with a male's body than of one whom they think of as a male erotically aroused by the idea of being female.  [Bailey 2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5893630_What_Many_Transgender_Activists_Don't_Want_You_to_Know_and_why_you_should_know_it_anyway)

They believe transsexuals are in denial about autogynephilia :

> We believe that advocacy for the standard feminine essence [brain in wrong body] narrative, and against Blanchard's theory, is primarily conducted by, or at least on behalf of, nonhomosexual transsexuals who incorrectly deny their autogynephilia [attraction to self as a female]... Some clinicians may also think that belief in the feminine essence narrative may be beneﬁcial for their patients' psychological health and social interactions, even if it does not correspond to the true etiology of their desire for sex reassignment.  [Bailey 2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5893630_What_Many_Transgender_Activists_Don't_Want_You_to_Know_and_why_you_should_know_it_anyway)

Evidence for autogynephilia:

> a common aspect of autogynephilia is the erotic fantasy of being admired, in the female persona, by another person.

> Autogynephilia appears to be a paraphilia. Paraphilias are unusual, intense, and persistent erotic interests... at least some paraphilias tend to occur together. Autogynephilia, for example, appears to be correlated with other paraphilias, especially masochism... Of men who die practicing the dangerous masochistic activity of autoerotic asphyxia, approximately 25% are cross-dressed, a much higher percentage than one would expect based on the number of nonhomosexual cross-dressers in the general population 

"The second author of this article" is a biological woman raised from birth as a boy, now living as a woman.

McHugh:

> I have not met or examined Jenner, but his behavior resembles that of some of the transgender males we have studied over the years. These men wanted to display themselves in sexy ways, wearing provocative female garb. More often than not, while claiming to be a woman in a man's body, they declared themselves to be "lesbians" (attracted to other women). The photograph of the posed, corseted, breast-boosted Bruce Jenner (a man in his mid-sixties, but flaunting himself as if a "pin-up" girl in her twenties or thirties) on the cover of Vanity Fair suggests that he may fit the behavioral mold that Ray Blanchard has dubbed an expression of "autogynephilia"—from gynephilia (attracted to women) and auto (in the form of oneself).  https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/06/15145/

### Homosexual Guilt

### Children and Gender Roles

McHugh:

> Then there is the subgroup of very young, often prepubescent children who notice distinct sex roles in the culture and, exploring how they fit in, begin imitating the opposite sex. Misguided doctors at medical centers including Boston's Children's Hospital have begun trying to treat this behavior by administering puberty-delaying hormones to render later sex-change surgeries less onerous—even though the drugs stunt the children's growth and risk causing sterility. Given that close to 80% of such children would abandon their confusion and grow naturally into adult life if untreated, these medical interventions come close to child abuse. A better way to help these children: with devoted parenting.[^mchugh-2016]

Zucker:

Rigid beliefs among young children about what girls and boys can do.  Developmental lag in gender constancy acquisition:

> Until children develop the capacity for concrete operational thought, typically between the ages of 5 and 7 years, they often conflate gender identity with surface expressions of gender behaviors (Kohlberg, 1966; Ruble, Martin, & Berenbaum, 2006). Thus, it is not particularly unusual for a 4-year-old girl to express the belief that, if she wore boys’ clothes and engaged in boys’ activities, then this would mean that she was a boy. It has also been reported in the normative gender development literature that younger children tend to have more rigid beliefs than older children about what boys and girls can do or should do (Ruble et al., 2006). In our own research, we have reported that children with GID appear to have a developmental lag in gender constancy acquisition (Zucker et al., 1999). Although it is unclear if this developmental lag can be understood
> as a predisposing factor, it can certainly be understood as a perpetuating factor (e.g., pervasive enactments of surface cross-gender behaviors could contribute to the maintenance of cognitive gender confusion).[^zucker-2012]

> [W]hen asked why he wanted to be a girl, one 7-year-old boy said that it was because he did not like to sweat and only boys sweat.  He also commented that he wanted to be a girl because he liked to read and girls read better than boys. An 8-year-old boy commented that “girls are treated better than boys by their parents” and that “the teacher only yells at the boys.” His view was that, if he was a girl, then his parents would be nicer to him and that he would get into less trouble at school.[^zucker-2012]

Zucker:  (also mentioned under therapy outcomes below)

> One 7-year old girl, for example, had a long-standing conflicted relationship with her father. Her father was extremely critical, abrasive, and mean to this her. She had numerous socioemotional problems: extreme oppositional behavior with the parents, intense jealousy directed toward a younger sister, many sensory sensitivities that resulted in ritualistic behaviors, and was, in general, a very challenging child to parent. A large part of the treatment with the father focused on discussing how his rage toward his child was not helpful and likely made matters worse. When parental psychopathology revolves around a gender-related axis, effort is made to explore the impact of this on their feelings toward the child. One mother of an 8-year-old boy wanted little to do with him. She was extremely depressed and withdrawn from her parenting role. She had been date raped as an adolescent and recalled that she dealt with this by becoming promiscuous... She acknowledged that she hated men. The only maneuver this boy could use to be close to his mother was to comb her hair (she was a hairdresser).[^zucker-2012]

David, age 9, discusses his gender dysphoria at age 5:

> David discussed his experience of bullying from peers for his gender atypical areas of
> interest. He speculated that, in many ways, his desire to become a girl may have been an effort to avoid the bullying from peers. David again reiterated the very reinforcing aspects of many of his female-typical interests. Finally, he reflected on his negative feelings about himself and his
> behavior and we considered his gender dysphoria as an effort to cope with these feelings. David continues to demonstrate a tendency towards preoccupations but, at present, has no symptoms characteristic of GID.

Linked with obsessional thinking, autism:

> Although the research is limited, especially for adults, there is an increasing amount of evidence that suggests a co-occurrence between gender dysphoria and ASD.[^glidden-2016]

> In our experience, children with GID generally show intense, if not obsessional, interests, in cross-
> gender activities. This propensity for intense interests may be magnified even further in those youngsters with a co-occurring ASD. Thus, a bridge between GID and ASD may be the predisposition for obsessional or focused interests and extreme rigidity in thinking. Moreover, any attempt to interfere with the obsessionality may evoke intense anxiety. It is common for parents of these youngsters to report a series of obsessions (e.g., with a particular color, with a particular book that must be read over and over in ritualistic fashion, with specific objects, such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners, etc.).[^zucker-2012]

Insecure attachment relationship to the mother:

> One of my students, Birkenfeld-Adams, showed that about 75% of young boys with GID had an insecure attachment relationship to the mother. Unpublished data suggest that a similar percentage of girls with GID also have an insecure attachment relationship to the mother.[^zucker-2008]

### Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria in Teens:

Social fad, clustering

McHugh:

> Another subgroup consists of young men and women susceptible to suggestion from "everything is normal" sex education, amplified by Internet chat groups. These are the transgender subjects most like anorexia nervosa patients: They become persuaded that seeking a drastic physical change will banish their psycho-social problems. "Diversity" counselors in their schools, rather like cult leaders, may encourage these young people to distance themselves from their families and offer advice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery. 

Rapid rise:

> Doctors are also concerned that social contagion is driving the “new” gender dysphoria. In England, the number of girls identifying as transgender skyrocketed by 4,400% in a decade. And according to one study, the number of American youth diagnosed with gender dysphoria nearly tripled over a recent five-year period.    https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2023/08/90219/

#### Littman 2018

Littman, Lisa.  "[Rapid-onset gender dysphoria in adolescents and young adults: A study of parental reports](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)."  PLOS One.  2018.

==See problems-in-lgbt-studies.md which documents and sources a lot of this more concisely.==

##### Methods:

Most responding parents were pro LGBT. 

> the vast majority of parents favored gay and lesbian couples’ right to legally marry (85.9%) and believed that transgender individuals deserve the same rights and protections as other individuals in their country (88.2%).

 [The Federalist, 2018](https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/31/explosive-ivy-league-study-repressed-for-finding-transgender-kids-may-be-a-social-contagion/):

> 86 percent of the parents who took this survey said they support same-sex relationships and 88 percent “believe trans people deserve the same rights and protections as everyone else.” Similar numbers supported their kids’ decision to adopt opposite-sex hairstyles, clothes, and so forth. Of the children who told their parents they wanted to see a gender therapist, 82 percent took them.

Non-random sampling though:

> Recruitment information with a link to a 90-question survey, consisting of multiple-choice, Likert-type and open-ended questions was placed on three websites where parents had reported sudden or rapid onsets of gender dysphoria occurring in their teen or young adult children.

And recruited from websites:

> Three of the sites that posted recruitment information expressed cautious or negative views about medical and surgical interventions for gender dysphoric adolescents and young adults and cautious or negative views about categorizing gender dysphoric youth as transgender. One of the sites that posted recruitment information is perceived to be pro-gender-affirming. 

1. 4thwavenow - left leaning, "We are strong supporters of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people", but against puberty blockers
2. transgender trend - against transgenderism but pro homosexual
3. [youthtranscriticalprofessionals](https://web.archive.org/web/20180107195012/https://youthtranscriticalprofessionals.org/about/) - "left-leaning, open-minded, and pro-gay rights" but concerned that youth are being diagnosed with transgenderism too quickly.

None of them were gender dysphoric when they were younger:

> It is important to note that none of the AYAs described in this study would have met diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in childhood (Table 3). In fact, the vast majority (80.4%) had zero indicators from the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for childhood gender dysphoria with 12.2% possessing one indicator, 3.5% with two indicators, and 2.4% with three indicators.  

The author notes "some may ultimately benefit from transition" so is not against transitioning kids.

##### Patterns:

> 41% of the AYAs had expressed a non-heterosexual sexual orientation before identifying as transgender.

> Many (62.5%) of the AYAs had reportedly been diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder or neurodevelopmental disability prior to the onset of their gender dysphoria

> The adolescents and young adults (AYAs) described by their parents were predominantly female sex at birth (82.8%) with an average current age of 16.4 years (range, 11–27 years)

> The majority (76.5%) of the surveyed parents felt that their child was incorrect in their belief of being transgender .

> More than a third (33.7%) of the AYAs asked for medical and/or surgical transition at the same time that they announced they were transgender-identified. Two thirds (67.2%) of the AYAs told their parent that they wanted to take cross-sex hormones; 58.7% that they wanted to see a gender therapist/gender clinic; and 53.4% that they wanted surgery for transition.  Almost a third (31.2%) of AYAs brought up the issue of suicides in transgender teens as a reason that their parent should agree to treatment. More than half of the AYAs (55.9%) had very high expectations that transitioning would solve their problems in social, academic, occupational or mental health areas.

##### Mental health problems

Mental health problems prior to transgender identity:

> The majority (62.5%) of AYAs [adolescent and young adult] had one or more diagnoses of a psychiatric disorder or neurodevelopmental disability preceding the onset of gender dysphoria (range of the number of pre-existing diagnoses 0–7). Many (48.4%) had experienced a traumatic or stressful event prior to the onset of their gender dysphoria. Open text descriptions of trauma were categorized as “family” (including parental divorce, death of a parent, mental disorder in a sibling or parent), “sex or gender related” (such as rape, attempted rape, sexual harassment, abusive dating relationship, break-up), “social” (such as bullying, social isolation), “moving” (family relocation or change of schools); “psychiatric” (such as psychiatric hospitalization), and medical (such as serious illness or medical hospitalization). Almost half (45.0%) of AYAs were engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behavior before the onset of GD. Coping styles for these AYAs included having a poor or extremely poor ability to handle negative emotions productively (58.0%) and being overwhelmed by strong emotions and trying to avoid (or go to great lengths to avoid) experiencing them (61.4%). The majority of respondents (69.4%) answered that their child had social anxiety during adolescence; 44.3% that their child had difficulty interacting with their peers, and 43.1% that their child had a history of being isolated (not associating with their peers outside of school activities).  [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

Mental health problems after becoming transgender:

> Although small numbers of AYAs [adolescent and young adult] had improvement in mental well-being (12.6%), parent-child relationship (7.4%), grades/academic performance (6.4%), and had broadened their interests and hobbies (5.1%); the most common outcomes were worsened mental well-being (47.2%); worsened parent child relationship (57.3%); unchanged or mixed grades/academic performance (59.1%); and a narrowed range of interests and hobbies (58.1%).  
>
> ...
>
> 1. Expressed distrust of information about gender dysphoria and transgenderism coming from mainstream doctors and psychologists (51.8%); 
> 2. tried to isolate themselves from their family (49.4%); 
> 3. expressed that they only trust information about gender dysphoria and transgenderism that comes from transgender websites and/or transgender people and sources (46.6%); 
> 4. lost interest in activities where participants aren’t predominantly transgender or LGBTIA (32.3%); stopped spending time with friends who were not transgender (25.1%); 
> 5. expressed distrust of people who were not transgender (22.7%). 
> 6. Many AYAs have also: withdrawn from their family (45.0%); 
> 7. told other people or posted on social media that their parent is “transphobic,” “abusive,” or “toxic” because the parent does not agree with child’s self-assessment of being transgender (43.0%); 
> 8. refused to speak to their parent (28.5%), 
> 9. defended the practice of lying to or withholding information from therapists or doctors in order to obtain hormones for transition more quickly (16.5%); 
> 10. tried to run away (6.8%). 
>
> The behaviors and outcomes listed above were considered significant changes from the child’s baseline behaviors for 71.4% of respondents checking any of the items.  [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

Turning against parents:

> A total of 63.8% of the parents have been called “transphobic” or “bigoted” by their children for one or more reasons, the most common being for: 
>
> 1. disagreeing with the child about the child’s self-assessment of being transgender (51.2%); 
> 2. recommending that the child take more time to figure out if their feelings of gender dysphoria persist or go away (44.6%); 
> 3. expressing concerns for the child’s future if they take hormones and/or have surgery (40.4%); 
> 4. calling their child by the pronouns they used to use (37.9%); 
> 5. telling the child they thought that hormones or surgery would not help them (37.5%); 
> 6. recommending that their child work on other mental health issues first to determine if they are the cause of the dysphoria (33.3%); 
> 7. calling the child by their birth name (33.3%); 
> 8. or recommending a comprehensive mental health evaluation before starting hormones and/or surgery (20.8%) 
>

##### Rewriting their history

> One parent said, “…she is actively rewriting her personal history to support the idea that she was always trans.” Another respondent added,”…my daughter denies events I recollect from her childhood and puberty that contradicts her narrative of ‘always knowing she was a boy.’” Another respondent offered, “He is rewriting his personal history to suit his new narrative.” And a fourth respondent described, “[Our] son has completely made up his childhood to include only girl friends and dressing up in girls clothes and playing with dolls, etc. This is not the same childhood we have seen as parents.”

##### Social Factor:

Increasing rate of post puberty females:

> some clinicians have noted that they are seeing increasingly in their clinic, the phenomenon of natal females expressing a post-puberty rapid onset of gender dysphoria. Some researchers have suggested that increased visibility of transgender people in the media, availability of information online, with a partial reduction of stigma may explain some of the increases in numbers of patients seeking care, but these factors would not explain the reversal of the sex ratio, disproportionate increase in adolescent natal females, and the new phenomenon of natal females experiencing gender dysphoria that begins during or after puberty.

Happens in groups:

21.5% + 45.3% = 66.8% belonged to a group where others had already become transgender.  This doesn't also include gay/bisexual kids in the group:

> the AYAs belonged to a friend group where one or multiple friends became gender dysphoric and came out as transgender during a similar time as they did (21.5%), exhibited an increase in their social media/internet use (19.9%), both (45.3%), neither (5.1%), and don’t know (8.2%)

> Within friendship groups, the average number of individuals who became transgender-identified was 3.5 per group.  In 36.8% of the friendship groups described, parent participants indicated that the majority of the members became transgender-identified.

> The expected prevalence of transgender young adult individuals is 0.7%. Yet, according to the parental reports, more than a third of the friendship groups described in this study had 50% or more of the AYAs in the group becoming transgender-identified in a similar time frame. This suggests a localized increase to more than 70 times the expected prevalence rate.

> Parents have described clusters of gender dysphoria outbreaks occurring in pre-existing friend groups with multiple or even all members of a friend group becoming gender dysphoric and transgender-identified in a pattern that seems statistically unlikely based on previous research.

> Peer contagion has been shown to be a factor in several aspects of eating disorders. 

Not due to selecting transgender friends:

> the described pattern of multiple friends (and often the majority of the friends in the friend group) *becoming* transgender-identified in a similar timeframe suggests that there may be more than just friend selection behind these elevated percentages.

More common to become transgender among the intelligent and gay:

> Nearly half (47.4%) of the AYAs had been formally diagnosed as academically gifted, 4.3% had a learning disability, 10.7% were both gifted and learning disabled, and 37.5% were neither... Overall, 41% of the AYAs expressed a non-heterosexual sexual orientation prior to disclosing a transgender-identification.

Online influence:

> The majority of respondents (69.2%) believed that their child was using language that they found online when they “came out.” 

> There are many examples on popular sites such as Reddit (www.reddit.com with subreddit ask/r/transgender) and Tumblr where online advice promotes the idea that nonspecific symptoms should be considered to be gender dysphoria, conveys an urgency to transition, and instructs individuals how to deceive parents, doctors, and therapists to obtain hormones quickly

Similar to anorexia

>  The descriptions of pro-anorexia subculture group dynamics where the thinnest anorexics are admired while the anorexics who try to recover from anorexia are ridiculed and maligned as outsiders resemble the group dynamics in friend groups that validate those who identify as transgender and mock those who do not. And the pro-eating-disorder websites and online communities providing inspiration for weight loss and sharing tricks to help individuals deceive parents and doctors [42–44] may be analogous to the inspirational YouTube transition videos and the shared online advice about manipulating parents and doctors to obtain hormones.

Gaining acceptance.

> Parents described intense group dynamics where friend groups praised and supported people who were transgender-identified and ridiculed and maligned non-transgender people. Where popularity status and activities were known, 60.7% of the AYAs experienced an increased popularity within their friend group when they announced a transgender-identification and 60.0% of the friend groups were known to mock people who were not transgender or LGBTIA.

Support of teachers:

> she became untouchable in terms of bullying in school as teachers who ignored homophobic bullying …are now all at pains to be hot on the heels of any trans bullying

As a coping mechanism for other mental disorders:

> A maladaptive coping mechanism is a response to a stressor that might relieve the symptoms temporarily but does not address the cause of the problem and may cause additional negative outcomes. Examples of maladaptive coping mechanisms include the use of alcohol, drugs, or self-harm to distract oneself from experiencing painful emotions. One reason that the treatment of anorexia nervosa is so challenging is that the drive for extreme weight loss and weight loss activities can become a maladaptive coping mechanism that allows the patient to avoid feeling and dealing with strong emotions. In this context, dieting is not felt as distressing to the patient, because it is considered by the patient to be the solution to her problems, and not part of the problems. In other words, the dieting and weight loss activities are ego-syntonic to the patient. However, distress is felt by the patient when external actors (doctors, parents, hospital staff) try to interfere with her weight loss activities thus curtailing her maladaptive coping mechanism.

> Transition as a drive to escape one’s gender/sex, emotions, or difficult realities might also be considered when the drive to transition arises after a sex or gender-related trauma or within the context of significant psychiatric symptoms and decline in ability to function. Although trauma and psychiatric disorders are not specific for the development of gender dysphoria, these experiences may leave a person in psychological pain and in search of a coping mechanism.

> Emerging hypotheses include the possibility of a potential new subcategory of gender dysphoria (referred to as rapid-onset gender dysphoria) that has not yet been clinically validated and the possibility of social influences and maladaptive coping mechanisms. 

Separate them from those promoting transgenderism:

> Several AYAs expressed significant concern about the potential repercussions from their friend group when they concluded that they were not transgender after all. There were two unrelated cases with similar trajectories where the AYAs spent some significant time in a different setting, away from their usual friend group, without access to the internet. Parents described that these AYAs made new friendships, became romantically involved with another person, and during their time away concluded that they were not transgender.  In both cases, the adolescents, rather than face their school friends, asked to move and transfer to different high schools. One parent said that their child, “…couldn’t face the stigma of going back to school and being branded as a fake or phony…. Or worse, a traitor or some kind of betrayer…[and] asked us if we could move.” In the other case, the parent relayed that their child thought none of the original friends would understand and expressed a strong desire to “…get out of the culture that ‘if you are cis, then you are bad or oppressive or clueless.’” Both families were able to relocate and both respondents reported that their teens have thrived in their new environments and new schools. [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

> Statistically significant differences were revealed for AYAs with exposure to social influences having worse outcomes for mental well-being and parent-child relationships, and greater numbers exhibiting distrust, isolating and anti-social behaviors including: narrowed range of interests and hobbies, expressing that they only trusted information from transgender sources, trying to isolate themselves from their family, losing interest in activities that weren’t predominantly with transgender or LGBTIA participants, and telling people or posting on social media that their parent is “transphobic,” “abusive,” or “toxic” because the parent doesn’t agree with the child’s assessment of being transgender. [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

##### Effects

Littman 2018 surveyed only parents who were concerned about their child's transition:

> Parents reported subjective declines in their AYAs’ mental health (47.2%) and in parent-child relationships (57.3%) since the AYA “came out” and that AYAs expressed a range of behaviors that included: expressing distrust of non-transgender people (22.7%); stopping spending time with non-transgender friends (25.0%); trying to isolate themselves from their families (49.4%), and only trusting information about gender dysphoria from transgender sources (46.6%). Most (86.7%) of the parents reported that, along with the sudden or rapid onset of gender dysphoria, their child either had an increase in their social media/internet use, belonged to a friend group in which one or multiple friends became transgender-identified during a similar timeframe, or both.  [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

> Participants described that their children and friend group seemed to focus on feeling as though they were victims.  [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

Post puberty kids with rapid onset gender dysphoria usually misrepresent or omit critical information to their doctor:

> When asked about whether their child relayed their history completely and accurately to clinicians or whether they misrepresented or omitted parts of their history, of those who knew the content of their child’s visit, 84.2% of the parent respondents were reasonably sure or positive that their child had misrepresented or omitted parts of their history.  [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

Rewriting their history:

> In addition to the previously mentioned case where the child literally rewrote her history by editing her diary, there were seven [out of 256] respondents who conveyed a process where their child was constantly rewriting their personal history to make it consistent with the idea that they always were transgender and/or had created a childhood history that was not what others had observed. It is unclear whether this process was deliberate or if the individuals were unaware of their actions.  [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

> In the 1990s, the beliefs and practices of many mental health professionals may have contributed to their patients’ creation of false childhood memories consistent with a child sexual abuse narrative and research since then has shown that false childhood memories of mundane events can be implanted in laboratory settings. It may be worthwhile to explore if, in today’s culture, there might be beliefs and practices of some mental health professionals that are contributing to their patients’ creation of false childhood memories consistent with an “always knew/always were transgender” narrative.  [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

#### Diaz and Bailey, 2023

[Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria: Parent Reports on 1655 Possible Cases](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9)

Recruited parents who had visited ParentsofROGDKids.com, which warns about the dangers of the "affirmative approach" and of transitioning.  It only included parents who said their kid's childhood was normal, without showing any discomfort with their gender, then suddenly identified as another gender.

Survey involved 1665 parents, after screening.  93% of respondents sub-sampled (70 out of 75) were politically progressive.

Figure 2 shows that mental health issues very commonly preceded gender dysphira by 1-4 years.

> Asked whether any stressful events in their AYA child’s life may have contributed to the onset of gender dysphoria, 72.6% (*N* = 1,161) of parents said “yes.” ... a number of parents noted that the family had moved recently. Others mentioned the youth’s romantic difficulties. But a few said that the youth had suffered severe physical or sexual abuse, and several mentioned that a friend or relative had committed suicide.

More common among the intelligent:

> In general, ratings were high, with only 15.5% (*N* = 255) of youths rated as average or below average, and 35.6% (*N* = 587) rated as having exceptionally high intelligence. 

Figure 3 shows that change in functioning is much worse after social transition.  But keep in mind the self-selection bias of this survey.

Hormones and hormone blockers are rare, surgical transition even rarer:

> In general, steps toward medical transition were unusual. For example, hormone blockers were reported for only 0.8% of natal females and 2.0% of natal males (test of the sex difference... The most frequently reported medical intervention was cross-sex hormones, received by 6.5% of females and 8.4% of males... Surgical transition was especially rare, reported for 1% of males and 0.7% of females.

Those in contact with gender specialists had twice the rate of hormonal treatment.  Gender dysphoria for over a year increased rate of hormonal treatment by almost 10x:

> Males whose gender dysphoria had persisted longer than one year had a 23.8% rate of hormonal treatment, compared with a 3.0% rate for those with a shorter duration; for females these figures were 13.6% and 1.3%, respectively. Males with both indicators of mental health issues (see above) had a hormonal treatment rate of 8.8%, compared with 7.6% for those with neither indicator; for females these figures were 8.7% and 3.7%. Finally, males who had contact with gender specialists had a hormonal treatment rate of 12.2%, compared with 6.6% for those without such contact; for females these rates were 10.1% and 4.8%.

Highly social in nature:

> Asked whether the youths were friends with others who “came out as transgender around the same time,” 55.4% of parents (*N* = 917) said “yes.” That response was significantly higher regarding natal females (60.9%, *N* = 760) than natal males (38.7%, *N* = 157)



> Youths with a history of mental health issues were especially likely to have taken steps to socially and medically transition... The finding is concerning because youth with mental health issues may be especially likely to lack judgment necessary to make these important, and in the case of medical transition permanent, decisions.

## Biological Differences between Men and Women

### Biological:

Ryan T Anderson, page 97:

> The result is that male and female bodies differ not only in their sex chromosomes (XX and XY) and in their organization for reproduction, but also, on average, in size, shape, bone length and density, fat distribution, musculature, and various organs including the brain. These secondary sex differences are not what define us as male or female; organization for reproduction does that. But this organization leads to other bodily differences. There are organizational differences and organism-wide differences in organs and tissues, as well as differences at the cellular and molecular levels. These differences affect not just our physiology, but also our minds.

Brain Differences:

> Indeed, after the reproductive organs, the brain is possibly the most "sexed" organ in a human being. This is not to say that there are male brains and female brains, but that on average there are differences in the brains of males and females that tend to make a difference in how men and women experience emotion and pain, how they see and hear, and how they remember and navigate.
>
> Larry Cahill, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Irvine, reviewed the literature for Scientific American in 2012 and reported "a surge of findings that highlight the influence of sex on many areas of cognition and behavior, including memory, emotion, vision, hearing, the processing of faces and the brain's response to stress hormones."20 There are differences in the size of various regions and structures in the brain, as well as differences at the cellular level." In the journal Endocrinology, Cahill cites "abundant evidence" showing that "sex influences on brain function are ubiquitous, found at every level of neuroscience.

Disease differences.  Ryan T Anderson, page 98ish:

> the "incidence and severity of diseases vary between the sexes." The difference between male and female is thus "an important basic human variable that should be considered when designing and analyzing studies in all areas and at all levels of biomedical and health-related research."  The chapter titles of the report sum up basic truths about our bodily nature: "Every Cell Has a Sex." "Sex Begins in the Womb." "Sex Affects Behavior and Perception." "Sex Affects Health." Some of the biological differences between the sexes that bear on health derive from hormone exposure, but others come more directly from our genetic material. There are "multiple, ubiquitous differences in the basic cellular biochemistries of males and females that can affect an individual's health. Many of these differences do not necessarily arise as a result of differences in the hormonal regime to which males and females are exposed but are a direct result of the genetic differences between the two sexes."  Chapter titles are from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222287/

### Innate Psychology

Newborn babies have different preferences.  Ryan T Anderson, page 987ish:

> We know that differences between the sexes begin in the womb, and they are manifested in our behavior from infancy. Many researchers have found that young children show a distinct pattern in choosing toys: "Boys tend to gravitate toward balls or toy cars, whereas girls more typically reach for a doll," Cahill notes.  Whether this difference comes from nature or nurture was long a subject of debate, until some researchers did an experiment to observe the play habits of vervet monkeys. Given a selection of toys, "male monkeys spent more time playing with the 'masculine' toys than their female counterparts did, and female monkeys spent more time interacting with the playthings typically preferred by girls."  These results cannot be explained away by reference to cultural stereotypes or the social pressures that operate among humans.  
>
> It's also difficult to blame socialization for the differences in how newborn human babies respond to objects and to people. Girls tend to show more interest in their mothers than boys do. Girls typically prefer movies showing faces, while boys prefer movies showing cars. Cahill cites a study that found these preferences in one-day-old infants, long before nurture could have any effect: the baby girls looked more at a face, while the baby boys looked more at a mechanical object. This pattern of behavior in the first day of life indicates that "we come out of the womb with some cognitive sex differences built in."  A recent study using MRIs suggested that, on the whole, "male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes." 

Mental health differences between men and women

Ryan T. Anderson page 100ish:

> These biological differences seem to have consequences for mental health. An article in the Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Review points to well-known differences between men and women in susceptibility to mental disorders: "Examples of male-biased conditions include autism, attention deficit/hyper-activity disorder, conduct disorder, specific language impairment, Tourette syndrome, and dyslexia, and examples of female-biased conditions include depression, anxiety disorder, and anorexia nervosa." This is not to say that these are exclusively male or female conditions, but that one sex or another experiences them with greater frequency.

## Prevalence

1 in 20k who have had a name and gender change on state documents:
http://www.census.gov/srd/carra/15_03_Likely_Transgender_Individuals_in_ARs_and_2010Census.pdf (page 6)

1 in 333 who identify as transgender (but now the link reports much higher numbers, archive.org doesn't have old version)
http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/how-many-people-are-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender/

That means only 1 in 60 who identify as transgender go far enough to change their name and sex on state documents.

Singh 2012:

> For example, De Cuypere et al. (2007) estimated that 1 in 12,900 biological adult males in Belgium have GID, while Weitze and Osburg (1996) estimated a prevalence rate of 1 in 42,000 in Germany. The estimated prevalence rate in most other studies have fallen within this range (i.e., 1/12,900-1/42,000). Based on these estimated rates, it seems reasonable to presume that the prevalence of GID is low. In Steensma et al.’s (2012) prospective study, only 1 (0.1%) of the 879 participants, a biological male, had undergone gender reassignment (cross-sex hormonal treatment and surgery) when followed up in adulthood.

Investigations that only include individuals with transgender diagnostic codes, hormone therapy, or gender-affirming surgery report a much lower rate of approximately 0.008% of the population [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063965/#REF2)]. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063965/

## Effects

TODO: A lot of this is also under Types and Casues -> Psychological

> Nuttbrock et al. (2010) found that 50.1% of male-to-female transgendered adults (from a sample of 517) experienced physical abuse while 78.1% experienced verbal abuse that was related to their gender identity/gender role... Grossman, D’Augelli, and Salter (2006) found that 87% of male-to-female transgendered youth had experienced some type of victimization. These percentages appear to be higher than the estimated victimization rates for youth in North America of 50%-62% (e.g., Kilpatrick, Saunders, & Smith, 2002; Romano, Bell, & Billette, 2011; Saunders, 2003).  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

### Suicide 

Transgender activists commonly admit the suicide rates are high.

American Academy of Pediatrics survey of 120k kids 11 to 19 years old:

> Nearly 14% of adolescents reported a previous suicide attempt; disparities by gender identity in suicide attempts were found. Female to male adolescents reported the highest rate of attempted suicide (50.8%), followed by adolescents who identified as not exclusively male or female (41.8%), male to female adolescents (29.9%), questioning adolescents (27.9%), female adolescents (17.6%), and male adolescents (9.8%).   https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/142/4/e20174218/76767/Transgender-Adolescent-Suicide-Behavior?redirectedFrom=fulltext

Williams Institute Summary of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey data:

> The prevalence of suicide attempts among respondents to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS), conducted by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and National Center for Transgender Equality, is 41 percent, which vastly exceeds the 4.6 percent of the overall U.S. population who report a lifetime suicide attempt, and is also higher than the 10-20 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual adults who report ever attempting suicide ... Prevalence of suicide attempts is elevated among those who disclose to everyone that they are transgender or gender-non-conforming (50%) and among those that report others can tell always (42%) or most of the time (45%) that they are transgender or gender non-conforming even if they don’t tell them...  https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-GNC-Suicide-Attempts-Jan-2014.pdf

Don't know if suicides are higher before or after transition:

> As has been noted, the NTDS instrument did not include questions about the timing of suicide attempts relative to transition, and thus we were unable to determine whether suicidal behavior is significantly reduced following transition-related surgeries, as some clinical studies have suggested  https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-GNC-Suicide-Attempts-Jan-2014.pdf

Signh suggests higher suicide rates are from discrimination and victimization.

> It has been estimated that 3.13%-4.6% of adults in the United States have made at least one suicide attempt (Kessler, Borges, & Walters, 1999; Weissman et al., 1999). In staggering contrast, studies of community samples of youth who self-label as transgendered have found that approximately 30-40% have made at least one suicide attempt (Clements-Nolle, Marx, & Katz, 2006; Grossman & D’Augelli, 2007; Maugen & Shipherd, 2010).  [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

### Sucidality due to associated mental illnesses?

> “Clinical gender dysphoria does not appear to be predictive of all-cause nor suicide mortality when psychiatric treatment history is accounted for.  https://www.transgendertrend.com/the-suicide-myth/

> At the same time, people with gender dysphoria who commit suicide have a very high rate of co-occurring serious psychiatric diagnoses, which in themselves sharply increase risks of suicide. Therefore, it is not possible to ascertain to what extent gender dysphoria alone contributes to suicide, since these psychiatric diagnoses often precede suicide.  https://www.transgendertrend.com/the-suicide-myth/

### Crime:

unchecked:

> Men who identify as trans commit sexual offenses at a rate 639x higher than women. Bottom line: "Trans women" are not women.
>
> https://x.com/robbystarbuck/status/1831804995915935764

Puberty Blockers

> The President of WPATH says that none of the boys who had their puberty blocked have been able to have an orgasm as an adult. Marci Bowers, a man identifying as a woman, says "It's really about zero," and then proceeds to speculate about what to do.  The woman in the middle is the infamous Johanna Olson-Kennedy, who buried the results of her taxpayer-funded $9.7 million dollar study, because it showed puberty blockers weren't helping kids.  https://x.com/BillboardChris/status/1856167227239612759

## Negative Effects due to discrimination?

75% have other psychiatric problems:

> Research shows that at least 75 percent of patients with gender dysphoria have other psychiatric problems. In the group of children and young adults, autism, eating disorders, self-harm behavior and abuse are common. For all these conditions there is evidence-based treatment. Given such, gender dysphoria often disappears, as it is usually secondary to these conditions.
>
> https://www.transgendertrend.com/the-suicide-myth/

> This raises the question of whether trans youth are especially vulnerable to suicidal ideation (the ‘minority stress’ explanation) or troubled and vulnerable young people are more susceptible to the belief that they are transgender (and believe that this is the reason for their distress and that transition will solve all their problems).  https://www.transgendertrend.com/the-suicide-myth/

> The common narrative is that trans youth have a high rate of attempted suicide and that the reasons for this are transphobia in society and lack of support. There is no evidence to support this claim. A detransition survey found that discrimination was the lowest scoring reason for feelings of regret about transition:
>
> > “By far, the two most common reasons for detransition were shifting political/ideological beliefs, at almost 63%, and finding alternative coping mechanisms for dysphoria, at 59%. The three most commonly cited reasons for detransition among trans activists–financial concerns, lack of social support, and institutional discrimination were among the lowest, at 18%, 17%, and 7%–in fact, institutional discrimination was the lowest scoring category.”  
>
> https://www.transgendertrend.com/the-suicide-myth/

> > **Conclusions** Clinical gender dysphoria does not appear to be predictive of all-cause nor suicide mortality when psychiatric treatment history is accounted for.
>
> > **Clinical implications** It is of utmost importance to identify and appropriately treat mental disorders in adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria to prevent suicide.  https://www.transgendertrend.com/the-suicide-myth/

## Fluidity / Changing

### Desistance in children



### Desistance In Children (uncategorized)

The idea that some children decide they aren't transgender is unpopular among many transgender people:

> So when they and their allies encounter claims that many gender-dysphoric kids aren’t *really* trans, or won’t be in the long run, they hear in those claims some loud and uncomfortable echoes.[^singal-2016]  

#### Predicting

> Severity of childhood cross-gender behavior was a significant predictor of sexual orientation at follow-up.
>
> [...]
>
> These results suggest that there is also an association between severity of childhood cross-gender behavior and sexual orientation outcome. Within the desistence group, the boys who were more cross-gender identified developed a bisexual/homosexual sexual orientation and the boys who were less extreme in their cross-gender identification developed a heterosexual sexual orientation. [^singh-2012]

Although it's not an absolute predictor:

> [Singh] also found in her research that plenty of GIC clients who exhibited rather severe gender dysphoria later went on to desist. So in the view of her and other GIC clinicians, there's nowhere near enough data for anyone to be making big decisions based solely or primarily on how insistent a 5-year-old is that they were born the wrong gender—especially given that these clinicians can also point to specific examples from their own professional experience of kids who appeared to be quite gender dysphoric at a specific point in time, but later grew up to be cisgender.  https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html

#### Desistance Rates

> Despite the document’s call for careful mental-health screening and its acknowledgment that **most cases** of childhood gender dysphoria naturally resolve during puberty, endocrinologists recognize that some of their peers are rushing young patients to irreversible hormonal treatments.[^eappen-2023]  

> Gender dysphoria (GD) of childhood describes a psychological condition in which a child experiences marked incongruence between his experienced gender and the gender associated with his biological sex. When this occurs in the prepubertal child, GD resolves in the **vast majority** of patients by late adolescence.  Cretella:  https://www.jpands.org/vol21no2/cretella.pdf

McHugh:

> When children who reported transgender feelings were tracked without medical or surgical treatment at both Vanderbilt University and London’s Portman Clinic, **70%-80%** of them spontaneously lost those feelings. Some 25% did have persisting feelings; what differentiates those individuals remains to be discerned.[^mchugh-2016]

Slate published a response to the WSJ article:
http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/06/16/the_wall_street_journal_displays_shocking_ignorance_about_lgbtq_issues.html

Another counter-argument to fluidity:

> All have been shown to have numerous shortcomings. In some, nearly 40% of young people surveyed did not meet the criteria for the official gender dysphoria diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders edition used at the time. In two, researchers classified some subjects as having detransitioned—or reversed their transition—purely on the basis of whether a parent or third party said it happened. A 2018 study found that three of the papers labeled those who had stopped responding to researchers as detransitioners; and in one, a subject who identified as nonbinary was classified as detransitioning.  https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/18/1057135/transgender-contagion-gender-dysphoria/

> Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, a transgender-affirmative clinician at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, insists that "it's clear, it's clear. I think that once you see hundreds and hundreds of kids you get a feeling for kids that are and kids that aren't." (Anderson 139)

From Dr. Zucker's Toronto clinic:

> one former GIC clinician, who didn’t want to be named, told me. “My sample size is not huge, but I’ve had many kids who have been quite insistent and have felt as though it” — meaning a transgender identity — “didn’t fit within several years.”  https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html

Among those that receive treatment to resolve gender dysphoria:

> In our own follow-up studies, we have found a persistence rate of **12%** for GID girls (n = 25; Drummond et al., 2008) and a persistence rate of **13.3%** for GID boys (n = 135; Singh et al., 2010).[^zucker-2012]

Sexology Today's review of 11 studies from 1972 to 2013:

> The exact number varies by study, but roughly **60–90%** of trans- kids turn out no longer to be trans by adulthood.[^cantor-2016]

Jesse Singal in 2016:

> It appears that about **80 percent** of kids with gender dysphoria end up feeling okay, in the long run, with the bodies they were born into.
>
> Again: **Every study that has been conducted on this has found the same thing.** At the moment there is strong evidence that even many children with rather severe gender dysphoria will, in the long run, shed it and come to feel comfortable with the bodies they were born with.   The critiques of the desistance literature presented by Tannehill, Serano, Olson and Durwood, and others don’t come close to debunking what is a small but rather solid, strikingly consistent body of research.[^singal-2016]  

Dr. James Barret, psychatrist at the oldest gender identity service in the UK:

> If you wait until puberty has got a little way along, a **fair proportion** of the children change the clinical presentation and feel more like straightforward lesbian and gay kids,” said Barrett. “They don’t seek social role change any more and will end up with no need for lifelong medical intervention, surgery and with no loss of natural fertility should they want children.[^singal-2016] 

Hruz:

> Pediatric patients referred to our practice for the evaluation and treatment of gender dysphoria are cared for by an interdisciplinary team of providers that includes a psychologist and pediatric endocrinologist who have been specifically chosen for this role based upon a special interest and professional knowledge and training in this rare patient population...  the vast majority of children who report gender dysphoria will, if left untreated, grow out of the problem — a natural coping-developmental process — and willingly accept their biological sex.  https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/legal-documents/045-3_paul_hruz_declaration.pdf

> Participants were 2772 adolescents (53% male) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey population and clinical cohort...  In early adolescence, 11% of participants reported gender non-contentedness.  The prevalence decreased with age and was 4% at the last follow-up (around age 26).[^rawee-2024]

#### Steensman 2013

(one of Cantor's larger studies)

My summary:  Of 127 kids < 12 diagnosed with gender dysphoria who received no treatment until > 15 years age, 47 persisted, 46+6+4 = 56 desisted, and 24 are of unknown status.  Of those with a known status, 46% persisted and 54% desisted.  Perhaps a follow-up at later than age 15 would've revealed more desisters.  It's also hard to imagine that the 80 missing patients were more likely to persist than desist than those who stayed.  If they all desisted that's an 80% desistence rate.  So we should say that at least 54% and possibly up to 80% desisted.

Steensman et al looked at 79 boys and 48 girls who where, at < 12 years old, diagnosed with gender dysphoria in Amsterdam, who were now more than 15 years old.  37% (23 boys, 24 girls) had "reapplied to the clinic in adolescence, requested medical treatment, were diagnosed again with GID, and considered eligible for [hormonal] treatment."

> we assumed that for the 80 adolescents (56 boys and 24 girls), who did not return to the clinic, that their GD had desisted, and that they no longer had a desire for gender reassignment

> Of the 80 desisters, 46 adolescents sent back the questioners (57.5%) and 6 (7.5%) adolescents refused to participate, but allowed their parents to fill out the parent questionnaires. Twenty-eight adolescents were classified as nonresponders: 12 (15%) did not send back the questionnaires despite follow-up contacts, another 12 (15.0%) were untraceable. In 4 cases (5.0%), the adolescents and the parents indicated that the GD from the past remitted, but these individuals refused to participate.

All 47 of the persisters and 52/80 desisters (or their parents) responded to the questionnaire.  12 could not be contacted because they were untraceable.  An additional 4 indicated the gender dysphoria remitted but did not respond to the survey.

> Older children and girls were more likely to be persisters than younger children and boys.

> Clinically, for the GIIAA, scores of less than 3 indicate GD;16 87.2% of the persisters met the criterion compared to 0% of the desisters. For the UGDS, scores of more than 40.0 indicate GD (Steensma, Kreukels, Jurgensen, € Thyen, de Vries and Cohen-Kettenis, unpublished material, 2013); 97.9% of the persisters met the criterion compared to 2.2% of the desisters (1 bisexual, natal girl).

Thinking you're transgender is more likely to make kids persist than wishing you were the other sex:

> When asked with what sex they identified (“Are you a boy or a girl?”), children who expressed cross-gender identification had a greater chance of persisting GD... Persisters indicated that they believed that they were the “other” sex, and the desisters indicated they wished they were the “other” sex

#### Singh 2012

(one of Cantor's larger studies.  Same data as Zucker 2012?

##### Methods

https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf
Singh was a student of Ken Zucker and used patients of Dr. Zucker for her study.

Studied "139 boys with gender identity disorder (GID)."  Average assessment times were at age 7.49 (3-12) and 20.58 (13-39).  That's an average difference of 12.88 years, with a standard deviation of 6.07.

>  At follow-up, 17 participants (12.2%) were judged to have persistent gender dysphoria.

About half were homo/bisexual and half hetero/asexual:

> Regarding sexual orientation, 82 (63.6%) participants were classified as bisexual/ homosexual in fantasy and 51 (47.2%) participants were classified as bisexual/homosexual in behavior. The remaining participants were classified as either heterosexual or asexual.

> "The participation rate in this study was 95.9% of those who could be traced, 46 which is extremely high especially given that the mean duration between childhood assessment and follow-up was 12.88 years.

> The majority (63.3%) of boys in this study met complete diagnostic criteria for GID in childhood. The boys who did not meet the complete criteria showed some characteristics of cross-gender identification and some, based on the history provided by their parents, would have met full criteria had they been assessed earlier in development. Therefore, it is not likely that the subthreshold cases represented grossly false positives or inappropriate referrals.

Bias because it's Dr Zucker's clinic?

> Parents of cross-gender identified children who believe that their child is inherently transgendered and who do not view their child’s cross-gender identification as psychopathological may seek the support of clinicians who support transition rather than attend a clinic where the treatment philosophy does not include explicit support for gender transitioning in childhood. It is possible that the children referred to our clinic and, by extension, the participants in the study may represent a biased sample.

##### Approaches

Three approaches:

> That most boys did not continue to experience gender dysphoria in adolescence and adulthood and reported feeling happy and comfortable living as males raises the issue of “best practice” in clinical management of GID. At present, there are three therapeutic approaches for GID, each informed by distinct conceptual and philosophical assumptions regarding gender identity development: one actively attempts to work with the children and their parents to lessen the child’s gender dysphoria; in a second approach, there is no active attempt to lessen the child’s gender dysphoria or cross-gender behaviors; and a third, more recent, approach actively encourages gender transitioning in childhood and puberty blocking hormones as puberty approaches (if the gender dysphoria persists).

Early transitioners may be more reluctant to switch back.

> the decision to support an early transition raises the concern that a child may not feel free to switch back to a gender role aligned with his or her biological sex if he or she desires to do so in the future, a concern that is acknowledged by some clinicians who are supportive of early gender transitioning (e.g., Edwards-Leeper & Spack, 2012).  de Vries and Cohen-Kettenis (2012), in their description of the Dutch approach to treatment of children and adolescents with GID, provided an additional rationale for not recommending early transition. There is concern that children who transition very early (e.g., in preschool) may not realize that they are of the other natal sex and develop a sense of reality that is different from their physical reality that makes acceptance of the multiple treatments they will later need an unnecessarily difficult process. 

##### Findings

> Gender identity appears to be relatively malleable in childhood, but becomes less plastic as development progresses. However, the factors that underlie this malleability are far from understood

Heterosexual desisters ended up the best, bi/homosexual desisters were in the middle, and persisters were worst:

> the heterosexual desisters reported significantly less behavioral and psychiatric difficulties compared to the bisexual/homosexual persisters and, to a lesser extent, the bisexual/homosexual desisters. 

Is it only kids who don't meet criteria for gender dysphoria who desist?  No:

> The persistence rate of gender dysphoria was examined as a function of participants’ GID diagnostic status in childhood, that is, whether they met full diagnostic criteria or were subthreshold for the diagnosis. Of the 88 participants who met the full diagnostic criteria for GID in childhood, 12 (13.6%) were gender dysphoric at follow-up and the remaining 76 (86.4%) were no longer gender dysphoric. Of the 51 participants who were subthreshold for the GID diagnosis in childhood, 5 (9.8%) were gender dysphoric at follow-up and the remaining 46 (90.2%) were not.   A chi-square analysis revealed that these rates of persistence across subthreshold and threshold groups did not differ significantly.

Although a previous study did notice a difference:

> Wallien and Cohen-Kettenis’ sample size was large enough to allow for group comparisons to identify potential differences in childhood between the boys who persisted in their gender dysphoria from those who desisted... All of the boys who showed persistent gender dysphoria had met the full criteria for GID in childhood. However, of the 28 (traced) boys who desisted, 17 met full criteria for GID while the remaining 11 were subthreshold. Of the 19 boys who could not be traced at follow-up, 15 met full criteria for GID and 4 were subthreshold.  The persisters were also more extreme in their childhood cross-gender behaviors and identification...

And so did Steensman above.

Singh 2012 Table 17 shows those that desist in gross-gender behavior, especially heterosexual desisters, have better behavioral outcomes that those who persist.  A lower score is better.

| **Total T Score**         | **Persisters** | **Bi/Homosxual Desisters** | **Heterosexual Desisters** |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Childhood T               | 66.75          | 61.05                      | 64.48                      |

> The heterosexual desisters had, on average, [from self-reporting] a lower Internalizing T [Total Problems] score than both the bisexual/ homosexual persisters and the bisexual/homosexual desisters (both ps < .05), who did not differ from each other (p > .05). 

Singh also noted that 86.6% of the persisters and 80.3% of the bi/homosexual desisters "met criteria for one or more psychiatric diagnoses at follow-up (other than GID)."  But only 35.1% of desisters did.

> Of the 16 bisexual/homosexual persisters, data were available for 15 participants. Of these, 13 (86.6%) met criteria for one or more psychiatric diagnoses at follow-up (other than GID). Of the 66 bisexual/homosexual desisters, data were available for 51 participants. Of 145 these, 41 (80.3%) met criteria for one or more diagnoses. Of the 42 heterosexual desisters, data were available for 37 participants. Of these, 13 (35.1%) met criteria for one or more diagnoses... The heterosexual desisters, on average, met criteria for fewer diagnoses compared to the bisexual/homosexual desisters (p = .001) and to the bisexual/ homosexual persisters (p = .006)

Persisters and bi/homosexual desisters had more suicidal thoughts than desisters, as seen in table 24:

| Suicidal       | Persisters | Bi/Homosexual Desisters | Heterosexual Desisters |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Child Ideation | 23.1%      | 6.7%                    | 15.2%                  |
| Child Behavior | 15.4%      | 2.2%                    | 9.1%                   |
| Youth Ideation | 46.7%      | 19.1%                   | 11.4%                  |
| Youth Behavior | 40%        | 4.3%                    | 8.6%                   |

> The bisexual/homosexual desisters reported, on average, a greater number of lifetime suicide attempts compared to the heterosexual desisters but were comparable to the bisexual/homosexual persisters. 

> Studies have shown that 177 children with GID have more peer relationship difficulties than their siblings and non-GID peers (e.g., Cohen-Kettenis et al., 2003; Zucker, Bradley, & Sanikhani, 1997)

Suicide and self harm:

> The bisexual/homosexual persisters were significantly more likely to endorse suicidal and self-harm behaviors compared to the bisexual/homosexual desisters, heterosexual desisters, referred boys in the standardization sample, and non-referred boys in the YSR and ASR standardization samples. 

Other studies citing higher rates of suicidality:

> One controversial mental health issue pertaining to sexual minority youth concerns suicidality ideation and suicide attempts (Zucker, 2010b). Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth, in addition to being at greater risk for mental health disorders (e.g., Cochran, 2001; Meyer, 2003), are also at greater risk for suicidal behaviors (Halpert, 2002; Kulkin, Chauvin, & Percle, 2000) compared to heterosexual counterparts. In a recent meta-analysis, King et al. (2008) concluded that sexual minorities were 2.47 times more likely to have attempted suicide in their lifetime. Further, high rates of suicide attempts among sexual minority individuals does not appear to simply be an artifact of high rates of mental disorder in this 216 group, but, rather, occurs independent of psychiatric diagnosis at higher rates than heterosexual individuals (Bolton & Sareen, 2011). Although epidemiological studies have not been conducted, available data on transgendered youth using community samples suggest a greater risk for suicidal ideation and self harm (e.g., Almeida et al., 2009; Mathy, 2003) compared to non-transgendered youth. That there is elevated risk for suicidality among homosexual and transgendered youth was supported by results of the present study. 

Cites alternate views about whether victimization causes the negative psychological outcomes.  But lists these as evidence it doesn't:

> Further support for the hypothesis that sexual minority youth may be psychiatrically vulnerable comes from a recent study of 4942 adult twin pairs which found that genetic factors accounted for 60% of the correlation between sexual orientation and depression (Zietsch et al., 2012). It is possible that the bisexual/homosexual persisters originated within families with higher levels of psychiatric difficulties and, therefore, had higher risk for developing such problems, compared to the heterosexual desisters. This is, of course, speculative as family psychiatric history was not systematically assessed



#### Counter-arguments

Some argue that the kids in these studies weren't actually gender dysphoric, but perhaps just gender nonconforming.  E.g. Brynn Tannehill:

> the desistance narrative is built upon bad statistics, bad science, homophobia and transphobia.... when investigators reviewed the files of children admitted to CAHM, 42 percent of them never met the clinical criteria for juvenile gender dysphoria in the first place … half of the kids Dr. Zucker claimed to ‘cure’ were never transgender in the first place.  https://web.archive.org/web/20171220145311/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-end-of-the-desistance_b_8903690.html

Tannehill continues:

> These children [at Zucker’s clinic] are not necessarily brought in for “gender dysphoria” but for gender non-conformity. I’ve already conceded (as most trans activists & advocates would), many of these gender non-conforming kids will not grow up to be cross-gender-identified.[^singal-2016] 

Tannehill originally claimed 72 percent never met the criteria for gender dysphoria, and "90 percent of the kids..." but was corrected by Jesse Singal.[^singal-2016] 

But that's not true, as Singal notes:

> as Singh points out in her dissertation, there wasn’t even a statistically significant difference in the desistance rates between those who did and didn’t meet the criteria — subthreshold kids were *just as likely* to eventually identify as trans.   

Also, the criteria for gender dysphoria as defined in the DSM-4 must meet four of the five criteria:

> **A.** A strong and persistent cross-gender identification (not merely a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex. AA In children, the disturbance is manifested by four (or more) of the following:
>
> 1. Repeatedly stated desire to be, or insistence that he or she is, the other sex.
> 2. In boys, preference for cross-dressing or simulating female attire; in girls, insistence on wearing only stereotypical masculine clothing.
> 3. Strong and persistent preferences for cross-sex roles in make-believe play or persistent fantasies of being the other sex.
> 4. Intense desire to participate in the stereotypical games and pastimes of the other sex.
> 5. Strong preference for playmates of the other sex.
>
> In adolescents and adults, the disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as a stated desire to be the other sex, frequent passing as the other sex, desire to live or be treated as the other sex, or the conviction that he or she has the typical feelings and reactions of the other sex.
>
> **B.** Persistent discomfort with his or her sex or sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex.
>
> In children, the disturbance is manifested by any of the following: In boys: assertion that his penis or testes are disgusting or will disappear or assertion that it would be better not to have a penis, or aversion toward rough-and-tumble play and rejection of male stereotypical toys, games, and activities.
>
> In girls: rejection of urinating in a sitting position, assertion that she has or will grow a penis, or assertion that she does not want to grow breasts or menstruate or marked aversion toward normative female clothing.
>
> In adolescents and adults, the disturbance is manifested by symptoms such as preoccupation with getting rid of primary and secondary sex characteristics (e.g., request for hormones, surgery or other procedures to physically alter sexual characteristics to simulate the other sex) or belief that he or she was born the wrong sex.
>
> **C.** The disturbance is not concurrent with a physical intersex condition.
>
> **D.** The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.[^singal-2016] 

It’s hard to imagine a kid meeting all the necessary criteria in the DSM-4 and not actually being gender dysphoric.

Media denial:

> Unfortunately, many progressive media outlets have done a poor job covering desistance and detransition. Vice and Vox and ThinkProgress have all written misleading articles falsely claiming that desistance is a 'myth' (or close to it), that detransitioners are nothing more than pawns for
> transphobic bigots to make it harder for people to transition, or both.[^singal-2017]

### Desistence Rates After Transitioning

This study looked at 312 kids aged 3 and 12 years who had fully socially transitioned.  Says only 2.5% detransition after 5 years:

> We found that an average of 5 years after their initial social transition, 7.3% of youth had retransitioned at least once. At the end of this period, most youth identified as binary transgender youth (94%), including 1.3% who retransitioned to another identity before returning to their binary transgender identity. A total of 2.5% of youth identified as cisgender and 3.5% as nonbinary.   https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/2/e2021056082/186992/Gender-Identity-5-Years-After-Social-Transition?autologincheck=redirected

> The idea that a child with gender dysphoria even *needs* a full psychological examination is now seen as inappropriate by some.  https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html

Puberty blockers

> In fact, every one of the children placed on puberty blockers in the Dutch clinic persisted in a transgender identity, and they generally went on to begin cross-sex hormone treatment at around age sixteen.   (Anderson 137)

Conservative pediatrician and former ACP director Michelle Cretella:

> There is an obvious self-fulfilling nature to encouraging a young boy with GD to socially impersonate a girl and then institute pubertal suppression. Given the well established phenomenon of neuroplasticity, the repeated behavior of impersonating a girl alters the structure and function of the boy’s brain in some way—potentially in a way that will make identity alignment with his biologic sex less likely. This, together with the suppression of puberty that prevents further endogenous masculinization of his brain, causes him to remain a gender non-conforming prepubertal boy disguised as a prepubertal girl. Since his peers develop into young men and young women, he is left psychosocially isolated. He will be less able to identify with being male and more likely to identify as “non-male.” A protocol of impersonation and pubertal suppression that sets into motion a single inevitable outcome (transgender identification) that requires life-long use of synthetic hormones, resulting in infertility, is neither fully reversible nor harmless.  https://www.jpands.org/vol21no2/cretella.pdf

> The "greatest lifelong benefit" comes from accepting a gender identity concordant with one's biological sex, Dr. Hruz says. "Any intervention that interferes with the likelihood of resolution is unwarranted and potentially harmful."

McHugh:

> The medical treatments provided for children with apparent symptoms of gender dysphoria, including affirmation of gender expression from the earliest evidence of cross-gender behaviors, may drive some children to persist in identifying as transgender when they might otherwise have, as they grow older, found their gender to be aligned with their sex.  https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/growing-pains

> they also note that none of their own patients who were found eligible for sex reassignment decided against it. But the fact that none of the patients for whom they recommended sex reassignment decided against the procedure may either indicate that their recommendations were based on a sound diagnosis of persistent gender dysphoria, *or* that their diagnosis — along with the course of treatment that followed from it, including gender-affirmative psychotherapy and puberty suppression — may have solidified the feelings of cross-gender identification in these patients, leading them to commit more strongly to sex reassignment than they might have if they had received a different diagnosis or a different course of treatment. https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/growing-pains

## Change Efforts

Singh 2012:

> In one approach, the goals of treatment are: (1) to circumvent the consistently observed sequelae of GID (e.g., ostracism by peers, depression), (2) to help children feel more comfortable with their biological sex, thereby reducing/alleviating gender dysphoria, (3) to increase the likelihood of desistance of GID in adolescence and adulthood, and (4) to alleviate co-occurring socioemotional problems in the child or difficulties within the family dynamic that may play a role in the child’s gender confusion (e.g., Meyer-Bahlburg, 2002; Zucker & Bradley, 1995; Zucker et al., 2012b).  Dreger (2009) labeled this approach the “therapeutic model,” in contrast to the “accommodating” model described below. (Singh 2012)

Zucker's approach tries to directly modify a child's gender identity.  The Dutch Approach tries to fix the associated mental health issues:

> Regardless of the etiological framework, a common thread among these clinicians is the assumption that it is possible to modify a child’s gender identity (e.g., Meyer-Bahlburg, 2002; Zucker, 2008b). In a variation of the therapeutic approach, clinicians in the Netherlands place the emphasis of treatment on concomitant emotional/behavioral problems in the child as well as family dynamics rather than on direct attempts to modify gender identity (Cohen-Kettenis & Pfäfflin, 2003; de Vries & Cohen-Kettenis, 2012). The rationale for this approach is that, if the concomitant problems have contributed to causing or maintaining the gender dysphoria, then the dysphoria will likely disappear by addressing these problems. de Vries and Cohen-Kettenis have recently referred to the approach used in the Netherlands as the **“Dutch approach.”**  (Singh 2012)

McHugh:

> With body dysmorphic disorder, an often socially crippling condition, the individual is consumed by the assumption "I'm ugly."  These disorders occur in subjects who have come to believe that some of their psycho-social conflicts or problems will be resolved if they can change the way that they appear to others.
>
> [...]
>
> How to respond? Psychiatrists obviously must challenge the solipsistic concept that what is in the mind cannot be questioned. Disorders of consciousness, after all, represent psychiatry's domain; declaring them off-limits would eliminate the field.  Many will recall how, in the 1990s, an accusation of parental sex abuse of children was deemed unquestionable by the solipsists of the "recovered memory" craze.
>
> [...]
>
> Treatments here must begin with removing the young person from the suggestive environment and offering a counter-message in family therapy.[^mchugh-2016]

McHugh:

> Based on the photographic evidence one might guess Bruce Jenner falls into the group of men who come to their disordered assumption through being sexually aroused by the image of themselves as women. He could have been treated for this misaligned arousal with psychotherapy and medication.   https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/06/15145/

> Traditional psychosocial treatments for gender dysphoria, such as those employed by Dr. Zucker, are therefore prudent and natural; they work with and not against the facts of science and the predictable rhythms of children’s psycho-sexual development. They give gender dysphoric children the opportunity to reconcile their subjective gender identity with their objective biological sex without any irreversible effects or the use of harmful medical treatments.[^mchugh-2017]

Zucker, "perhaps the world's leading expert on treating discordant gender identity in children" thinks that gender dysphoria in adults is frequently best treated by hormones and surgery.

McHugh cites Drummond 2008:

> Dr. Kenneth Zucker, long acknowledged as one of the foremost authorities on gender dysphoria in children, spent years helping his patients align their subjective gender identity with their objective biological sex. He used psychosocial treatments (talk therapy, organized play dates, and family counseling) to treat gender dysphoria and had much success.[^mchugh-2017]

More McHugh:

> Policies and protocols that treat children who experience gender-atypical thoughts or behavior as if they belong to the opposite sex, on the contrary, interfere with the natural progress of psycho-sexual development. Such treatments encourage a gender dysphoric child... to adhere to his or her false belief that he or she is the opposite sex. These treatments would help the child to maintain his or her delusion but with less distress by, among other aspects, requiring others in the child’s life to go along with the charade.

Girls treated for gender dysphoria at a Toronto clinic:

> This study provided information on the natural histories of 25 girls with gender identity disorder (GID). Standardized assessment data in childhood (mean age, 8.88 years; range, 3–12 years) and at follow-up (mean age, 23.24 years; range, 15–36 years) were used to evaluate gender identity and sexual orientation. [...]
>
> At the assessment in childhood, 60% of the girls met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for GID, and 40% were subthreshold for the diagnosis.  At follow-up, 3 participants (12%) were judged to have GID or gender dysphoria. [...]
>
> A preliminary analysis compared the assessment information from childhood of the 25 girls who participated in the study with that of the 12 girls who did not participate.  [...]
>
> In answering these questions, 22 participants (88%) reported no distress with their female gender identity at follow-up. None of the participants desired contrasex hormones or sex reassignment surgery to masculinize their bodies, nor did they express a desire to get rid of their female sex characteristics. [...]
>
> All 3 gender dysphoric participants wished they had been born a boy and wondered whether they would have been happier as a boy. Two of these individuals indicated a desire to have surgery to masculinize their bodies. The other participant classified as gender dysphoric reported indifference with regard to altering her physical appearance but felt that “it was better to be neutral.” [...]
>
> In Zucker (2005b), a follow-up on 40 boys with GID from the same clinic, using the same methods as in the present study, showed a persistence rate of 20%, only modestly higher than the rate of 12% for the girls in the present study.[^drummond-2008]

What does therapy look like?

> Frank was a 7-year-old boy who met the DSM criteria for GID. In contrast to his two brothers, Frank was described by his parents as more sensitive and emotional. He had a long history of an avoidance of rough-and-tumble play, complaining that other boys were both mean and aggressive. Indeed, one of his brothers, who had a history of severe disruptive behavior, had often been mean and aggressive towards him.  The problematic relationship with his brother appeared to generalize to Frank’s view of all boys, as he complained that all boys were mean.  He affiliated primarily with girls and, with them, engaged in a variety of stereotypical feminine activities. By age 5, he began to voice the wish to be a girl, stating that if he were a girl, then all of his problems would be solved.
>
> If one conceptualized Frank’s sensitive temperament as a predisposing, presumably biological factor, one could argue for an intervention that, in part, would focus on helping Frank recognize that there are a variety of ways to be a boy and that there are likely some boys in his social environment who are not pervasively mean or aggressive. Exposure of Frank to other boys whose temperament was more a match to his own could, in theory, help him to develop a more nuanced understanding of gender:  that there are different ways to be a boy, that one does not have to be
> a girl as a fantasy solution to cope with his difficulties with his aggressive brother or the more boisterous boys in the school environment, and so on.[^zucker-2012]

> When we conduct open-ended play psychotherapy (or simply talk therapy) with children, like any psychotherapeutic intervention for any issue, therapy begins with educating the child about the reason that they are in therapy. This is tailored to the child’s developmental level and cognitive sophistication. Some children are simply told that they are going to meet with an individual therapist to understand better their gender-related feelings and, during sessions, they are free to play with whatever they want (boys’ toys, girls’ toys, dress-up clothing, neutral and educational activities, etc.), to draw, to talk about day-to-day life, to report on their dreams, and so on...
>
> One 4-year-old girl, for example, had actually asked her parents to take her to see a therapist (she was very intelligent) because she was confused about why she wanted to be a boy. After the assessment, she seamlessly entered into a therapeutic process about her gender feelings...
>
> Individual open-ended psychotherapy enables many children with GID to discuss and to play out their gender identity issues, it affords them the opportunity to make sense of their internal representational world, and, in general, to master various developmental tasks with which they may be struggling. There is a reasonably large psychoanalytic case report literature on GID, for which the interested reader can glean some good examples of the process of open-ended psychotherapy (see Zucker, 2006a, 2008b; Zucker & Bradley, 1995).[^zucker-2012]

With parents:  Zucker:  (also mentioned under therapy outcomes below)

> One 7-year old girl, for example, had a long-standing conflicted relationship with her father. Her father was extremely critical, abrasive, and mean to this her. She had numerous socioemotional problems: extreme oppositional behavior with the parents, intense jealousy directed toward a younger sister, many sensory sensitivities that resulted in ritualistic behaviors, and was, in general, a very challenging child to parent. A large part of the treatment with the father focused on discussing how his rage toward his child was not helpful and likely made matters worse. When parental psychopathology revolves around a gender-related axis, effort is made to explore the impact of this on their feelings toward the child. One mother of an 8-year-old boy wanted little to do with him. She was extremely depressed and withdrawn from her parenting role. She had been date raped as an adolescent and recalled that she dealt with this by becoming promiscuous... She acknowledged that she hated men. The only maneuver this boy could use to be close to his mother was to comb her hair (she was a hairdresser).[^zucker-2012]

#### Summary

> It remains unknown whether the aforementioned treatment approaches are associated with different long term outcomes (e.g., persistence vs. desistence of GID, general psychiatric functioning, psychosocial adjustment).  (Singh 2012)

#### Criticism

The American Psychoanalytic Association in 2012:

> Psychoanalytic technique does not encompass purposeful attempts to “convert,” “repair,” change or shift an individual’s sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. Such directed efforts are against fundamental principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in substantial psychological pain by reinforcing damaging internalized attitudes.[^apsaa-2012]

The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT activist group, maintains a page[^hrc-2024] with similar statements from many other large groups, including:

### Studies showing harm

#### Jack Turban in 2019

Some studies claim to show that gender identity conversion efforts are harmful, but these studies are flawed.

In 2019, Jack Turban and associates found gender identity conversion recipients were "associated with severe psychological distress during the previous month," even years later.[^turban-2019]  But major methodological issues abound:

- In another case of asking the meat market about their success with vegetarianism, the respondents were recruited from LGBT+ organizations, which invariably view non-affirming gender therapy as harmful.[^turban-2019:a] [^transequality-2015:a]  
- The survey also excluded anyone who wasn't transgender, omitting any possible success stories from non-affirming gender therapy.[^turban-2019:b]  
- The survey responses were very poor quality, since 73% of the respondents said they started puberty blockers after age 18, when puberty blockers are only given before age 16.[^biggs-2020:a]



## Social transitioning, Hormones and Surgery

> By contrast, the risks are significant and include sterility, lifelong dependence on medication and the anguish of regret. For this reason, more and more European countries and international professional organizations now recommend psychotherapy rather than hormones and surgeries as the first line of treatment for gender-dysphoric youth[^kaltiala-2023]

### Social

> The most striking implication of an approach that facilitates early transitioning is that it may steer some children down a transgendered path who might have otherwise not desired to transition as they progress in development. Proponents of the early transitioning model have not addressed how this approach fits conceptually or clinically with the finding that the majority of children with GID show a desistence in adolescence (e.g, Drummond et al., 2008; Green, 1987; Wallien and CohenKettenis, 2008).  (Singh 2012)

McHugh:

> It is well-recognized, too, that repetition has some effect on the structure and function of a person’s brain. This phenomenon, known as neuroplasticity, means that a child who is encouraged to impersonate the opposite sex may be less likely to reverse course later in life.  For instance, if a boy repeatedly behaves as a girl, his brain is likely to develop in such a way that eventual alignment with his biological sex is less likely to occur.  Obviously then, some number of gender dysphoric children who would naturally come to peacefully accept their true sex are prevented from doing so by gender-affirming policies...[^mchugh-2017]

> Finally, gender-affirming policies aggressively promote the false notion that a child... is trapped in the wrong body; indeed, that is precisely these policies’ presupposition, even their *raison d’etre* [main purpose].[^mchugh-2017]

### Hormones

> Conscientious objectors in the AAP point to Europe’s U-turn on surgical and hormonal interventions. After England, Sweden, and Finland conducted systematic evidence reviews, they determined that there is no reliable evidence that such interventions are medically safe (in fact, the reviews document substantial bodily harm to these minors), nor that they actually relieve psychological distress in children over the long term. If anything, many of these children have pre-existing mental health issues that gender transition can exacerbate.  https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2023/08/90219/

> Every systematic review of evidence to date, including one published in the Journal of the Endocrine Society, has found the evidence for mental-health benefits of hormonal interventions for minors to be of low or very low certainty. By contrast, the risks are significant and include sterility, lifelong dependence on medication and the anguish of regret. For this reason, more and more European countries and international professional organizations now recommend psychotherapy rather than hormones and surgeries as the first line of treatment for gender-dysphoric youth.[^kaltiala-2023]

Not likely to be reversible

> the evidence that something like normal puberty will resume for these patients after puberty-suppressing drugs are removed is very weak. This is because there are virtually no published reports, even case studies, of adolescents withdrawing from puberty-suppressing drugs and then resuming the normal pubertal development typical for their sex... In developmental biology, it makes little sense to describe anything as “reversible.” If a child does not develop certain characteristics at age 12 because of a medical intervention, then his or her developing those characteristics at age 18 is not a “reversal,” since the sequence of development has already been disrupted.   https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/growing-pains

> At this year’s meeting, we had frank and fruitful discussions with endocrinologists who provide hormonal treatments to kids with gender dysphoria, as well as some who don’t. Without exception, they acknowledged that the society’s evidence base for pediatric gender transition is weak, at best.  Yet while they’re aware of the guidelines’ shortcomings, they’re afraid to voice their concerns. The society’s full-throated endorsement of gender-affirming care implied condemnation of anyone who holds differing views. Medical professionals are being cowed into silence and coerced into providing treatments they know are dangerous to children.  Perhaps the most telling interactions were with European endocrinologists, who were there to discuss the latest research and treatments in the specialty. Those we spoke with expressed surprise that the U.S. hasn’t banned, or at least severely restricted, such treatments for adolescents and children.[^eappen-2023]

McHugh:

> There is an obvious self-fulfilling nature to encouraging young [gender dysphoric] children to impersonate the opposite sex and then institute pubertal suppression. If a boy who questions whether or not he is a boy (who is meant to grow into a man) is treated as a girl, then has his natural pubertal progression to manhood suppressed, have we not set in motion an inevitable outcome? All of his samesex peers develop into young men, his opposite sex friends develop into young women, but he 16 remains a pre-pubertal boy. He will be left psycho-socially isolated and alone.[^mchugh-2017]

Hormones increase feelings of gender dysphoria:

> ‘Butler provides evidence that intervention with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) promotes a continued desire to identify with the non-birth sex — over 90% of young people attending endocrinology clinics for puberty-blocking intervention proceed to cross sex hormone therapy. In contrast, 73%–88% of prepubertal GD clinic attenders, who receive no intervention, eventually lose their desire to identify with the non-birth sex. Our concern is that the use of puberty blockers may prevent some young people with GD from finally becoming comfortable with the birth sex’.  https://www.transgendertrend.com/current-evidence/



### Not well studied / tested

Not known if safe:

> The development of these interventions should, therefore, occur in the context of research, and treatments for under 18 gender dysphoric children and adolescents remain largely experimental. There are a large number of unanswered questions that include the age at start, reversibility; adverse events, long term effects on mental health, quality of life, bone mineral density, osteoporosis in later life and cognition. We wonder whether off label use is appropriate and justified for drugs such as spironolactone which can cause substantial harms and even death. We are also ignorant of the long-term safety profiles of the different GAH regimens. The current evidence base does not support informed decision making and safe practice in children.  https://www.transgendertrend.com/current-evidence/

conservative Dr. Cretella in 2016:

> There is not a single large, randomized, controlled study that documents the alleged benefits and potential harms to gender-dysphoric children from pubertal suppression and decades of cross-sex hormone use. Nor is there a single long-term, large, randomized, controlled study that compares the outcomes of various psychotherapeutic interventions for childhood GD with those of pubertal suppression followed by decades of toxic synthetic steroids. In todays age of "evidence-based medicine," this should give everyone pause.  https://www.jpands.org/vol21no2/cretella.pdf

Sex Change is impossible

> At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. "Sex change" is biologically impossible. People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.[^mchugh-2016]

> the four best designed and conducted studies that assessed quality of life before and after surgery using validated (albeit non-specific) psychometric studies did not demonstrate clinically significant changes or differences in psychometric test results after GRS. (Heylens et al., 2014; Ruppin, Pfafflin, 2015; Smith et al., 2005; Udeze et al., 2008)  https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/view/ncacal-decision-memo.aspx?proposed=N&NCAID=282&bc=ACAAAAAAQAAA

> Conscientious objectors in the AAP point to Europe’s U-turn on surgical and hormonal interventions. After England, Sweden, and Finland conducted systematic evidence reviews, they determined that there is no reliable evidence that such interventions are medically safe (in fact, the reviews document substantial bodily harm to these minors), nor that they actually relieve psychological distress in children over the long term. If anything, many of these children have pre-existing mental health issues that gender transition can exacerbate.[^kao-2023]

Ryan T. Anderson:

> The University of Birmingham's aggressive research intelligence facility (Arif), as noted earlier, evaluated more than one hundred studies on people who had undergone sex reassignment surgeries. Commissioned by the Guardian in 2004, this review found no "conclusive evidence that gender reassignment is beneficial for patients," although most of the research "was poorly designed, which skewed the results in favour of physically changing sex." Anderson, page 116ish

Kuhn 2009's survey in Bern, Switzerland.

> Fifty-five transsexuals participated in this study. Fifty-two were male-to-female and 3 female-to-male. Quality of life as determined by the King's Health Questionnaire was significantly lower in general health, personal, physical and role limitations. Patients' satisfaction was significantly lower compared with controls. Emotions, sleep, and incontinence impact as well as symptom severity is similar to controls. Overall satisfaction was statistically significant lower in TS [transsexuals] compared with controls. [...]

>
> [...]
>
> The use of validated tools is strength of the study; however, a weakness is that we have no validated data before SRS [sex reassignment surgery]. During the study, patients reported anecdotally that their quality of life is better now than before SRS; however, VAS [visual analogue scale - a tool to assess health and satisfaction in patients] was significantly lower in TS compared with controls.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028208038387#:~:text=Quality%20of%20life%20as%20determined,severity%20is%20similar%20to%20controls.

McHugh:

> We at Johns Hopkins University—which in the 1960s was the first American medical center to venture into “sex-reassignment surgery”—launched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not. Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as “satisfied” by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn’t have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex-reassignment surgery, since producing a “satisfied” but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs.[^mchugh-2016]

#### Suicide rates

Suicide + hospitalization doubled for those who receive puberty blockers:
"The percentage of people who thought about suicide and actually made a plan to do it in the past 12 months is nearly the same for people who had puberty blockers (55.6 percent) and for those who did not (58.2 percent). Nearly the same!... 
The percentage of people who thought about suicide, made a plan and attempted suicide were higher for those who had blockers (24.4 percent versus 21.5 percent)...
The percentage of people who attempted suicide and were hospitalized in the last 12 months was DOUBLE for those who had blockers (45.5 percent versus 22.8 percent)."
And this survey was done by LGBT activists in a way more likely to sample those who are enthusastically transgender.

"A recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that approximately 80% reported subjective improvement in terms of gender dysphoria, quality of life, and psychological symptoms, but also that there are studies reporting high psychiatric morbidity and suicide rates after sex reassignment.  The authors concluded though that the evidence base for sex reassignment “is of very low quality due to the serious methodological limitations of included studies.”"

Surgery doesn't help:

> However, follow-up data on psychiatric outcome of transgendered individuals who receive cross-sex hormonal therapy and sex-reassignment surgery suggest that, even among individuals who receive medical treatment for gender dysphoria, there may be an increased risk for suicidality compared to the general population (Asscheman et al., 2011; Dhejne et al., 2011; van Kesteren, Asscheman, Megens, & Gooren, 1997). These findings are surprising as one would expect that sex-reassignment surgery, which will serve to align the body of transgendered individuals with their gender identity, would substantially reduce the gender dysphoria, if not eliminate it, and, therefore, reduce the risk for suicide.

##### 2011 Swedish Study

2011 study of 324 randomly selected sex-reassigned persons in Swedend.  aHR is adjusted hazard ratio.  2.8x higher mortality rate, 19.1x higher rates of death from suicide, and 4.9x higher suicide attempts, and 2.8x higher psychatric inpatient care:

> The overall mortality for sex-reassigned persons was higher during follow-up (aHR 2.8; 95% CI 1.8-4.3) than for controls of the same birth sex, particularly death from suicide (aHR 19.1; 95% CI 5.8-62.9). Sex-reassigned persons also had an increased risk for suicide attempts (aHR 4.9; 95% CI 2.9-8.5) and psychiatric inpatient care (aHR 2.8; 95% CI 2.0-3.9).[^dhejne-2011]

##### Bränström's 2019 Swedish Study

A 2019 Swedish study originally measured lower mental health treatments,[^brandstrom-2019] but was retracted due to cherry-picked data:

> Table 3 of their study showed that only 38 percent of people diagnosed with gender incongruence had any type of affirmative surgery, and only 53 percent of those—about 20 percent of the total—had surgery of the reproductive organs. Gender affirming surgery is free in Sweden, so where are these patients?... Overlooked were key data of completed suicides, healthcare visits, prescriptions, and hospitalizations for the litany of other medical or psychological diagnoses potentially related to gender-affirming treatments. Such information was available through Sweden’s multiple registry databases, so why not use it? These omissions suggested cherry-picking data in order to obtain the desired results.
>
> The reanalysis on the other hand showed an increase in treatment for anxiety after surgery.[^vanmol-2020]

"The authors ultimately recanted their initial misreporting and agreed that their study produced no evidence of benefits for gender reassignment hormone and surgical treatments."[^hruz-2021]

This was cited by U.S. Medicare in 2016:

> All-cause mortality was higher for patients who underwent gender reassignment surgery (n=27 [8.3%]) than in controls (hazard ratio 2.8 [CI 1.8-4.3]) even after adjustment for covariants (prior psychiatric morbidity and immigration status).

Conflicting data on benefit vs harm:

> Based on a thorough of the clinical evidence available at this time, there is not enough evidence to determine whether gender reassignment surgery improves health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with gender dysphoria. There were conflicting (inconsistent) study results—of the best designed studies, some reported benefits while others reported harms. The quality and strength of evidence were low due to the mostly observational study designs with no comparison groups, potential confounding and small sample sizes.  Many studies that reported positive outcomes were exploratory type studies (case-series and case-control)

##### Paul McHugh

> I have witnessed a great deal of damage from sex-reassignment. The children transformed from their male constitution into female roles suffered prolonged distress and misery as they sensed their natural attitudes. Their parents usually lived with guilt over their decisions—second-guessing themselves and somewhat ashamed of the fabrication, both surgical and social, they had imposed on their sons.  https://www.firstthings.com/article/2004/11/surgical-sex

##### Not successful:

> The original results already demonstrated no benefits to hormonal transition. That part didn’t need a correction. The largest dataset on sex-reassignment procedures—both hormonal and surgical—reveals that such procedures do not bring the promised mental health benefits. In fact, in their correction to the original study, the authors point out that on one score—treatment for anxiety disorders—patients who had sex-reassignment surgeries did worse than those who did not...
>
> And sadly, such surgeries can have deadly consequences. In a discussion of the then-largest and most robust study on sex reassignment, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pointed out: 'The study identified increased mortality and psychiatric hospitalization compared to the matched controls. The mortality was primarily due to completed suicides (19.1-fold greater than in control Swedes).'

Paul McHugh:

> The psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Jon Meyer was already developing a means of following up with adults who received sex-change operations at Hopkins in order to see how much the surgery had helped them. He found that most of the patients he tracked down some years after their surgery were contented with what they had done and that only a few regretted it. But in every other respect, they were little changed in their psychological condition. They had much the same problems with relationships, work, and emotions as before. The hope that they would emerge now from their emotional difficulties to flourish psychologically had not been fulfilled.  https://www.firstthings.com/article/2004/11/surgical-sex

##### Daniel Jackson, 2023

[Suicide-Related Outcomes Following Gender-Affirming Treatment: A Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10027312/)

> A narrative review was undertaken evaluating suicide-related outcomes following gender-affirming surgery, hormones, and/or puberty blockers. Of the 23 studies that met the inclusion criteria, the majority indicated a reduction in suicidality following gender-affirming treatment; however, the literature to date suffers from a lack of methodological rigor that increases the risk of type I error. There is a need for continued research in suicidality outcomes following gender-affirming treatment that adequately controls for the presence of psychiatric comorbidity and treatment, substance use, and other suicide risk-enhancing and reducing factors.

> Results Individuals who underwent gender-affirming surgery had a 12.12-fold higher suicide attempt risk than those who did not

But they only compared those who had gender surgery to those who were sterilized.  It would've been better to see of suicide was higher before or after surgery, or compared to transgenders who don't have surgery.

###### Methods

> Factors involved in the data propensity matching are based on age at index, race, ethnicity, and sex... To justify our use of propensity matching for age, race, sex, and ethnicity, we considered established risk factors for suicide such as older age, male gender identity, and racial or ethnic minority status

> Data gathered from HCOs was from February 4, 2003, to February 4, 2023...  The significance of this investigation lies not only in its scale but also in its methodology, as it relies on real-world data rather than meta-analyses and self-reported surveys.

There's no control against non-operative transgenders!

> It may be worth examining if groups considering gender-affirmation surgery who have not yet received the surgery share the same increased risk levels for suicidal actions and ideations.

#### Studies that say gender surgery works well:

> In this cross-sectional study of 139 survey respondents who underwent gender-affirming mastectomy, the median satisfaction score was 5 on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction. The median decisional regret score was 0 on a 100-point scale, with lower scores indicating lower levels of regret... The regret rate following gender-affirming surgery is thought to be approximately 1%  https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2808129

> We conducted a systematic literature review of all peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1991 and June 2017 that assess the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being. We identified 55 studies that consist of primary research on this topic, of which 51 (93%) found that gender transition improves the overall well-being of transgender people, while 4 (7%) report mixed or null findings. We found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm.   https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/

Young Adult Psychological Outcomes After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment, 2014:

> One study (Annelou L.C. de Vries et al., “Young Adult Psychological Outcomes After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment,” 134 Pediatrics 696-704 (2014)) reported some short-term benefits. But the authors made no effort to assess long-term effects, and their study was, in any event, not properly controlled. [^mchugh-2017]

In 2020, psychiatrist Jack Turban published a study claiming "pubertal suppression for transgender adolescents who want this treatment is associated with favorable mental health outcomes."  But:

- The number who planned suicide and attempted suicide was almost identical between both groups, and twice as many on puberty blockers were hospitalized for attempted suicide.
- Only the lifetime rate of suicidal thoughts were lower for those who received puberty blockers, which isn't a surprising claim when the survey participants were recruited from pro LGBT+ websites, which invariably advocate for puberty blockers.
- The survey responses were of very poor quality, since 73% of the respondents said they started puberty blockers after age 18, when puberty blockers are only given before age 16.[^biggs-2020:a]

#### Branstrom et al 2019

> A study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry by Branstrom et al. in October 2019 drew strong conclusions regarding the positive impact of gender-affirmation surgery on mental health [[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063965/#REF11)]. However, the study faced criticism of its methodology, leading to a correction/retraction by the journal's editors that stated, "the results demonstrated no advantage of surgery about subsequent mood or anxiety disorder-related health care visits or prescriptions or hospitalizations following suicide attempts”  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063965/

#### Almazan et al 2021

> In a subsequent study conducted in 2021, Almazan et al. compared the mental health outcomes of a group of patients who were not approved for gender-affirmation surgery with a group that had undergone the surgery [[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063965/#REF13)].
>
> Their findings suggested better mental health outcomes for those who underwent surgery, but notable limitations warrant careful interpretation. First, the study conducted a comparison between two groups: one that had not been approved for surgery, a process requiring two mental health screenings as per the World Professional Association for Transgender Health's standard of care recommendations, and another group that had already undergone surgery. Therefore, it is plausible that the surgery group could inherently have been healthier, irrespective of the surgery. Second, when the analysis was broadened to include lifetime outcomes, the positive association with the surgery became insignificant [[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063965/#REF14)].  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063965/

While our research specifically examined the risk of suicide, death, self-harm, and PTSD in the five years following surgery, Park et al. surveyed the outcomes of 15 gender-affirming surgeries over a more extended period. Their results reveal an improvement in patient well-being, with high satisfaction levels, reduced dysphoria, and persistent mental health benefits even decades after surgery. Notably, the study highlights the durability of these positive outcomes and significantly reduced suicidal ideation following gender-affirmation surgery.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063965/

A critical response:

> The researchers state up front that we know that the increase in trans ID in recent years is only because of greater social acceptance and availability of GAC. Apparently there's no controversy over this.  For their review of regret in research, the authors **uncritically** cite:  
>
> * the conclusions of the Bustos systematic review, which have been witheringly criticized for risk of bias, highly restrictive definitions of regret (the largest feeder study wouldn't have classified [@ChoooCole](https://twitter.com/ChoooCole) as a regretter), and other methodological problems. They also independently cite that feeder study (Wiepjes et al. 2018). 
> * a survey (30% response rate) of WPATH-affiliated surgeons, taking at face value their self-reports about how many patients regretted their procedures and ignoring evidence that detransitioners may not go back to the doctors who harmed them.  
> * a U of Michigan cross-sectional study (survey) that had a 59% response rate, median age at surgery of 27, and median follow-up at 3.6 yrs (never mind that the authors note that in Wiepjes study, average time to regret was almost 11 years).  
> * The US Transgender Survey of 2022, which explicitly excluded those who once identified as TGD but no longer do (i.e., desisters and regretters).  
> * The authors do not critically evaluate any of the studies or GRADE the evidence--essential components of a reliable systematic review. Nor do they engage with other peer-reviewed papers such as J. Cohn, "The Detransition Rate is Unknown" (2023), which provide critical assessments of existing literature. 
> * They conclude that dramatic sex trait modification surgeries, including on genitals, have FAR lower rates of regret than common elective procedures and "non-surgical life decisions" like getting a tattoo or having kids. This is nothing less than academic fraud enabled by a peer-reviewed medical journal.

#### Problems with Gender Clinics

Among kid with rapid, post-puberty onset, gender clinics usually don't ask for health records.  Sometimes offered meds on first visit:

> For parents who knew the content of their child’s evaluation, 71.6% reported that the clinician did not explore issues of mental health, previous trauma, or any alternative causes of gender dysphoria before proceeding and 70.0% report that the clinician did not request any medical records before proceeding. Despite all of the AYAs in this study sample having an atypical presentation of gender dysphoria (no gender dysphoria prior to puberty), 23.8% of the parents who knew the content of their child’s visit reported that the child was offered prescriptions for puberty blockers and/or cross-sex hormones at the first visit.  [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

> The findings that the majority of clinicians described in this study did not explore trauma or mental health disorders as possible causes of gender dysphoria or request medical records in patients with atypical presentations of gender dysphoria is alarming.  The reported behavior of clinicians refusing to communicate with their patients’ parents, primary care physicians, and psychiatrists betrays a resistance to triangulation of evidence which puts AYAs at considerable risk. [Littman, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330)

## WPATH



## Affirmation is not the right Treatment

### We don't affirm other dysphoria's

1. Body integrity identity disorder BIID - wheel chair
2. Anorexia - diet pills or lyposuction
3. Trans-aging - a 12 year old can't identify as an adult and have relationships with an adult.

Some may say that unlike the above examples, a trans identity is harmless, but this article shows otherwise.

It's harmful to encourage a kid to be dissatisfied with their otherwise healthy body and to think it should be something else, especially features they can't actually change.

It's harmful to encourage someone to take on a false view of their body that doesn't correspond to reality.

Kids are highly susceptible to suggestion and influence.  Affirming pushes them to embrace transgenderism, when most children naturally desist.

### Effects on Society

Whether he's sincere or not, a boy taking a transgender identity can gain access to the girls' bathroom, locker room, and showers.  He can creep up on that girl he likes and see her naked. He can also get naked in front of her if that's what turns him on.  He can stalk more effectively since she can't even avoid him in the bathroom.  Transgender policies make it much harder to prevent, catch, and prosecute stalkers, predators, and other deviants.  Instead of being able to sue a boy for stripping naked in front of your daughter, he can sue you for telling him to stop.

A deeper issue is that any behavior you "want to do really bad" is now not actually a behavior, but an "identity."  This leads to an abyss of moral relativism if we apply this to other behaviors:

1. Can a mother get a child tax credit for all of her son's multiple personalities, since each identifies as as separate person?  Or is only gender 
2. Suppose I "identify" as a night owl. Are restaurant owners bigots for not serving me breakfast after 11? Is daylight savings time owl-o-phobic?  Is it hiring discrimination to only accept applicants who can work first shirt?  
    1. If this seems absurd, it's less absurd than transgenderism since the physiological differences between race are much less than those between gender.

3. Can I identify as black or native American to get scholarships?  If people are offended, are they bigots who deny my identity?  If my therapist tells me that's a bad idea, is that "conversion therapy?"

How is it decided which behaviors are mental disorders (requiring compassionate help) and which are a protected legal status that must be celebrated?  It's all arbitrary, nothing is consistent, and there is no transgender advocate who doesn't simultaneously deny and discriminate against other alleged identities. 

Not sure who said this.  Matt Walsh?  Can't find segments of it anywhere online.
"If a boy adopts transgender status (whether or not he's sincere) he can gain ready access to the girl's locker room, the girl's showers, the girl's toilets, and he can creep on that girl he likes (or that girl he wants to be like) and he can see her naked. He can also get naked in front of the if that's what turns him on. He can stalk and creep more effectively since she can't even avoid him in the bathroom. This sort of policy makes it harder to prevent, catch, and prosecute those sexual deviants because Instead of being able to sue a boy for stripping naked in front of your daughter in the locker room, he can sue YOU for telling him to stop!"

Matt Walsh:

> If she is in a state of undress in the locker room and a boy walks in, she cannot tell him to leave. She has to shut up and deal with it. It’s her duty to be exposed and vulnerable for this boy’s sake. His desires, his fetishes, his feelings matter.  Hers don’t.

Just as we don't know what it feels like to be a bat (as Thomas Nagal argues), a boy doesn't know what it feels like to be a girl, so he can't say that he feels like he's a girl.

Transgenderism creates a power structure.  Because if you take this former taboo and say it has to be accepted, that gives you power people of a different political persuasion, because now you can say you're good and they're bad.  This is most effective when wielded by someone taking a trans identity, because now they can blame you for personal insult, and even seek monetary compensation for discrimination.

Even though you'd never think to do the same for any of these other identities.

## Common Misconceptions

### Born in the wrong Body

> Currently the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies. This understanding has little scientific basis, however, and is inconsistent with clinical observations.[^bailey-2007]

Paul McHugh:

> A gender dysphoric girl is not a boy trapped in a girl’s body, and a gender dysphoric boy is not a girl trapped in a boy’s body... Studies of brain structure and function have not demonstrated any conclusive, biological basis for transgenderism. [^mchugh-2017]

They compared brain scans of female living as a man to other females and saw no differences:

> Brain areas sensitive to gender dimorphism like left lingual gyrus and precuneus showed strong similarities between the FtM [female to male transgender] subject and female control group with respect to control males, with comparable extension and location of functional connectivity maps. ROI analysis confirmed this evidence, highlighting a greater pattern of differences between the FtM subject and males and the FtM subject and females. No difference between seed-voxel results in the FtM subject and females was found... These data partially support the idea that untreated FtM transgender shows a functional connectivity profile comparable to female control subjects.[^santarnecchi-2012]

Rametti published two studies and cited several more showing that some features of transgender brains are in between or closer to the opposite sex than the same sex.  But we don't know if this is lifelong or neuroplastic changes that come from living as the opposite sex

Survey of 18 FtM's:

> Structural brain differences in transsexuals have been addressed by postmortem anatomical as well as by in vivo neuroimaging studies. With respect to the former, it was shown in subcortical structures that the central nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), which is important for the male sexual behavior (Claro et al., 1995), is female in size (Zhou et al., 1995) and in neuron number (Kruijver et al., 2000) in male-to-female (MtF) transsexual subjects... The volume and number of neurons in the INAH3 of MtF transsexuals was similar to that of control females and this feminization was not due to estrogens treatment (Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab, 2008). The latter study included one FtM transsexual subject; the INAH3 volume and number of neurons was within the male control range (Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab, 2008).[^rametti-2011]

Paul McHugh commented on this study, saying:

> The results of that study may be explained by neuroplasticity[^mchugh-2017]

Study of 18 MtF's (opposite the above), 19 males and 19 females:

> Our results show that the white matter microstructure pattern in untreated MtF transsexuals falls halfway between the pattern of male and female controls. The nature of these differences suggests that some fasciculi [nerve fiber bundles] do not complete the masculinization process in MtF transsexuals during brain development.[^rametti-2011b]

12 nonhomosexual male-to-female transsexuals respond to smells similar to females:

> These data suggest a pattern of activation away from the biological sex, occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female-like features.[^berglund-2008]

### Disorders of Sexual Development

A person with an intersex disorder like Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) isn't a new gender, just like a person with Down's syndrome (having 3 copies of chromosome 21) isn't a new species.

Not considered a third sex:

> Disorders of sexual development (DSDs) occur in roughly one out of every 5,000 births-41 They can result in ambiguous external genitalia, a mismatch between internal and external reproductive organs, the Incomplete development of reproductive organs, and the formation of two sets of sex organs. These disorders m development are frequently caused by chromosomal or hormonal defects. People with DSDs do not constitute a third sex- Rather, DSDs are a pathology in the development and formation of the male or femalé body. This is the consensus view of medical experts who study and treat DSDs. As the pediatric endocrinologist Quentin L. Van Meter writes, "The exceedingly rare DSDs are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm. **The 2006 consensus statement of the Intersex Society of North America and the 2015 revision of the statement does not endorse DSD as a third sex.**"42 After all, biological sex is grounded in the organism's organization for reproduction. There is no third gonad. With DSDs, what can develop are dysfunctional ovaries and testes. 
>
> Disorders of sexual development can have a variety of causes. They can arise from genetic mutations, hormonal influences, the formation of a chimera or mosaic as an early embryo, or chromosomal abnormalities at fertilization.  (Ryan T. Anderson page 101-ish)

Treatment for DSD's is based on the likely cosmetic appearance of reconstructed genitals, potential for normal steroids, normal sex, and fertility:

> The standard treatment for people with DSDs—for example, a newborn baby with ambiguous genitalia—begins with trying to discern the causes of the disorder, which may shed light on the underlying sex of the child. Pediatric Endocrinology, a standard desk reference, says that after an "assessment of the anatomy of the sex organs," the decisions regarding a course of treatment should rest "**on the likely cosmetic appearance of the reconstructed genitalia, on the potential for normal sex steroid secretion at puberty, on the potential for normal sexual intercourse, and on the potential for fertility**." These children do not constitute a third sex; they are either male or female, but with a disorder in their development. The sound medical response is to identify the predominant underlying sex and then take measures to provide health and functioning, as far
> as possible, through hormones and possibly surgery. (Anderson page 104-ish)

> Most people with a DSD do not identify as transgender, and most people who do identify as transgender do not have a DSD. (Anderson page 106-ish)

Most boys and adults with GID have normally developed genitalia (Green, 1976). [Singh 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310082304/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)

### Redefining

If people with ambiguous sex means that gender doesn't exist, does that mean interracial people show that race doesn't exist, and I can identify as black?

### The War on Children Notes

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1759049663917838659

Companies push LGBT to have a good ESG score.

In the kid's movie Zootopia, the city's leadership drugged certain animal species making them turn violent, which predictably made other species fear them, as part of a plan for the government to assert stronger control.  This echoes the tactics of communist takeovers like China's Color Revolution, which used propaganda to turn the poor against the rich and educated, leading to mass violence and the death of millions, which Mao then used to seize power.

Here in the real world, the political Left and especially the LGBT movement have introduced new lifestyles that were traditionally taboo to nearly everyone.  LGBT lifestyles are now normalized store shelves, books, movies, and even children's media.  From frequent exposure, a portion of the population, especially the youth, now sees this as normal.  They then teach that anyone who doesn't accept LGBT the lifestyle us at best non-empathetic, or worst are a hateful enemy.  This predictably divides the population as we see happening today.

It's like a cult.  This is what's right and wrong, you have to believe it, and anyone who disagrees is an enemy.

A strong desire for affirmation and attention.  That makes them feel good and want to do more of it.

1:07:00 - 70% of pediatric patients are diagnosed with autism, ADHD, or some other mental disorder prior to being diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

1:20:08 - 53% of mothers of boys with reported gender dysphoria meet the criteria for borderline personality disorder.

### Judging

Derek:  Once people abandon grace in faith through Christ alone, then they need a way to deal with their guilt and shame. Not just morally, but in terms of failing to meet expectations, more generally - e.g. - divorced with wine and cats at age 40. And the way they've chosen is to stop the people who judge from judging ANYONE, so that they themselves are not judged.

### Division

### Sexual Perversion

1. Jeffrey Epstein taught us there's a sizeable group of very rich and powerful sexual perverts in the United States.
2. These men understandably would want all sexual taboos erased, and the easiest way to do this is to gradually advance normally taboo alternate forms of sexuality.
3. The rich give [hundreds of millions](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2020/01/the-billionaires-behind-the-lgbt-movement) of dollars to LGBT organizations, many of which promote acceptance of sexual taboos as compassionate, and rejection as bigotry.  Their investment firms then award good ESG scores to companies that promote LGBT, and withhold investment money from those that don't.
4. This promotion brings many other weak-minded men and women on board, who feel guilty and don't want to be seen as uncompassionate.  Or sexual perverts who also want to normalize all taboo forms of sex.
5. As a result, LGBT lifestyles are now normalized store shelves, books, movies, and even children's media.  From frequent exposure, a portion of the population, especially the youth, now sees this as normal.
6. Normalizing transgenderism especially feeds the goals of Epstein's rich clients.  If gender is fully mutable, why not age?

[^biggs-2020:a]: "Yet, 73% of respondents who reported having taken puberty blockers (question 12.9) said they started on them after the age of 18 years. As the survey report acknowledged, “the question may have been misinterpreted by some respondents who confused puberty blockers with the hormone therapy given to adults and older adolescents” (James et al., 2016, p. 126). Turban et al. (2020) did not mention this misinterpretation but did follow the report’s mitigation strategy of ignoring those respondents who reported taking puberty blockers after the age of 18. No such adjustment is possible, however, for the question asking whether the respondent had ever wanted puberty blockers (question 12.8), which Turban et al. (2020) used to define the subset of respondents in their analysis. The comparison group therefore included an unknown number of respondents—possibly the majority—who actually wanted cross-sex hormones."
