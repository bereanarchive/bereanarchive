# Daniel 9

## Summary

Daniel 9:24-26 uniquely predicts the year and month of Jesus’ crucifixion, with no credible alternative explanation:

1. Around 536 BC, Daniel prophesied through Gabriel that the Messiah would be killed exactly 483 years after the command to rebuild Jerusalem.
2. In March 444 BC, Persian King Artaxerxes Longimanus issued this specific decree.
3. Ancient Babylonian and Persian calendars used a 360-day year. Counting 483 prophetic years (173,880 days) from Artaxerxes' decree brings us precisely to March/April of 33 AD, the widely accepted date of Christ's crucifixion.

Historical evidence from the Septuagint and Dead Sea Scrolls conclusively establishes Daniel's authorship centuries before Christ, eliminating post-event writing. This prophecy remains unmatched in specificity, accuracy, and historical verifiability, confirming divine inspiration and Jesus as the promised Messiah.

## Relevant Verses (NET)

Daniel 9:24-27 outlines a timeline:

- **24** Seventy weeks (490 years) designated for ending sin, atonement, establishing righteousness, and completing prophecy.
- **25** From decree to rebuild Jerusalem until the Messiah: 7 weeks plus 62 weeks (totaling 483 years).
- **26** After these 483 years, the Messiah would be "cut off" (killed).
- **27** Sacrifices end in the middle of the final week, and abominations follow until destruction.

Nehemiah 2:1-8 describes Artaxerxes’ decree, specifically addressing the rebuilding of Jerusalem with walls and gates. Archaeological discoveries support Nehemiah’s rebuilding in distressful conditions, matching Daniel’s prophecy.

## Basic Interpretation

Daniel 9:25-26 predicts precisely 483 years (69 sets of 7 years) from Artaxerxes' decree (444 BC) until the Messiah’s death. The Hebrew term for "cut off" refers explicitly to judicial execution or covenant sacrifice, aligning perfectly with the crucifixion of Jesus.

The city and temple destruction prophesied in Daniel 9:26 was fulfilled by Titus in 70 AD. This strongly supports interpreting the prophecy literally.

### Daniel 9:27

Jesus ministered for about 3.5 years (half of a seven-year "week"). His death ended the need for sacrifices, fulfilling "bringing sacrifices and offerings to a halt." The second half likely points toward end-time events, supported by Daniel 12 and Matthew 24.

## Other Historical Interpretations

Attempts to attribute the prophecy to Caligula or Antiochus Epiphanes fail chronologically and contextually. Caligula’s attempts at desecration did not align with the timeline and never fully materialized. Antiochus lived centuries before Christ, invalidating the required 483-year timeline.

## Identifying the Correct Decree

Several Persian decrees occurred, but only Artaxerxes Longimanus’ 444 BC decree matches Daniel 9’s details:

- Explicitly authorized city reconstruction.
- Built during distressful opposition.
- Included walls and defensive structures ("plaza and moat").

Other decrees (Cyrus in 539 BC, Artaxerxes in 457 BC) mention only the temple or do not match chronologically when calculated forward.

Archaeological findings confirm Jerusalem’s fortifications were rebuilt precisely in Nehemiah’s time, supporting the 444 BC date.

## Dating Artaxerxes’ Decree

Reliable Babylonian tablets and papyri confirm Artaxerxes' accession year as 465 BC, making his 20th year (Nehemiah 2:1) precisely 444 BC. Jewish and Babylonian regnal-year calculations corroborate this date.

## Addressing Challenges

### Are "Sevens" Literal Years?

Yes. Hebrew word "shabuwa" means "group of seven," not exclusively weeks. Contextually, Daniel’s prophecy aligns with Israel’s 70-year exile for neglecting sabbatical years, reinforcing the interpretation of "sevens" as years. Additionally, Daniel 12 explicitly calculates half of the final "seven" as 1,290 days (~3.5 years), reinforcing the year-based interpretation.

### 360-Day Prophetic Years

Ancient Babylonians and Persians commonly used a 360-day calendar for administrative and prophetic calculations, validated by abundant historical records and scholarly consensus. Daniel, trained in Babylonian traditions, naturally employed this well-known calendar.

### Could Daniel Have Been Written Later?

No credible scholar argues Daniel was post-Christ. Septuagint (3rd century BC) translations and Dead Sea Scroll fragments (2nd century BC) firmly date Daniel centuries before Jesus, eliminating post-event fabrication.

### Jewish Expectations of the Messiah

Ancient Jewish texts (Sanhedrin, Rashi) acknowledge expectations of the Messiah’s arrival around the 1st century AD, aligning with Daniel’s timeline and further validating the prophecy’s clarity and historical understanding.

## Conclusion

No alternative explanation credibly addresses Daniel 9’s exact timing, historical context, and precise fulfillment in Christ’s crucifixion. Archaeology, astronomy, textual evidence, and historical records collectively confirm Daniel’s remarkable prophecy. The inescapable conclusion is that Daniel accurately predicted the crucifixion of Jesus centuries in advance, affirming the divine authenticity of biblical prophecy and the messianic identity of Jesus Christ.
