<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is a summary of key points from the rest of this article.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament are the military campaigns of Israel inconsistent with being led by a just and loving God, and inconsistent with his own commands?&nbsp;  This article makes the case for consistency and justness.
</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>The nations of Canaan were evil, harming others, and needed to be stopped. </b>They
		had carried out incest with children/grandchildren and sacrificed their
		children alive in raging fires. (Lev 18:6-30, Deut 12:31, Deut 18:9-10, Psalm
		106:35, 37-38, 2 Chron 28:3)&nbsp; They launched unprovoked attacks on Israel (Ex
		17:8-9, Num 21:1, Num 21:2-23, 33).&nbsp; The nation of Amalek "
		struck down all who lagged behind you." (Deut 25:18)</li>
	<li><b>Some warfare language may have been rhetorical.</b>&nbsp; There
		are four reasons to think warfare language such as "completely destroy"
		(Hebrew תחרימו, literally "ban") in verses like Deut 20:17 is rhetorical.&nbsp; The
		phrase likely meant a destruction of armed soldiers, buildings, and religious
		icons while driving out the people themselves.
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li>The "utterly destroyed" populations still exist afterward.&nbsp; We see phrases
				like "left no one remaining" and "utterly destroyed all who breathed" (Joshua
				10:40).&nbsp; But in Joshua 23:12-13 the author has no problem telling us these
				people still remained:
				 "if you turn back, and join the survivors of these nations
				left here among you...&nbsp; the Lord your
				God will not continue to drive out these nations before you."&nbsp; In 1
				Sam 15:3-4 Israel was to "attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have;
				do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep,
				camel and donkey."&nbsp; In 15:8 Saul "utterly destroyed all the people
				with the edge of the sword" and Agag himself was killed in 15:33.&nbsp; But later
				in 1 Sam 27:8-9 once again they left "neither man nor woman alive".&nbsp; Yet hundreds of years later in
				Esther 3:1 we're told Haman was an Agagite, a descendant of the Amalekite
				king Agag.</li>
			<li>Most verses on the subject speak of "driving out" and "dispossessing" the land
				rather than language suggestive of killing everyone.&nbsp; E.g. Num 33:52-53,
				"you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, destroy all 
				their figured stones, destroy all their cast images, and demolish all their high places. You
				shall take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the
				land to possess."&nbsp; The same pattern is seen in Lev 18:25, Num 23:31-32,
				Deut 6:19, 9:4, 18:12, Joshua 3:10, and 23:9.</li>
			<li>Jer 4:29 suggests inhabitants fled before armies arrived:&nbsp; "At the noise
				of horseman and archer every town takes to flight; they enter thickets;
				they climb among rocks; all the towns are forsaken."</li>
			<li>Deut 7:22 specifically says that Israel was forbidden to "you will not be able
				to make a quick end of them" and instead they would be expelled "little by little".</li>
			<li>Jewish to Christian convert Stephen likewise interpreted this to mean 
			his ancestors "dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors." (Acts 7:45)</li>
		</ol>So either some of these verses contradict one another, or the conquest language was rhetorical.&nbsp; Semitic
		language professor and NIV, NAB, and ESV bible translator Richard Hess argues
		that the Hebrew here is "stereotypical for describing all the inhabitants
		of a town or region, without predisposing the reader to assume anything further
		about their ages or even their genders"[^hess-2008c] and "need not
		require that there really were children, senior citizens, or women there who were
		put to death" even when followed by the terms "men and women" (Joshua
		8:25) or "young and old"[^hess-2009] (Joshua 8:25).&nbsp;
		<br>

	</li>
	<li><b>Many of the "cities" were likely military outposts.</b>&nbsp; For
		example with Jericho and Ai, Richard Hess argues there are no references to noncombatants
		(apart from Rahab), no archaeological evidence of non-military use, the term melek
		(Hebrew מלכי)&nbsp; for "king" of the cities often meant mean a military leader
		in Canaan (e.g. in Joshua 2:2), they were located at defensive positions,
		and Jericho and Ai weren't described as large cities as Gibeon and Hazor explicitly
		were.
	</li>
	<li><b>A just God requires wrath.</b>&nbsp; It's not possible to have a God
		who is just but not wrathful--otherwise wrongdoers continue unabated.</li>
</ol>

<p>These four points are outlined in greater detail in four corresponding sections
	below, followed by a review of the more "troublesome" passages with conquest language.</p>

<h2>The Guilt of the Canaanites</h2>
<h3>Canaanite Immorality</h3>
<aside>
	<img src="ancient-israel-morality-of-the-conquest-of-canaan-files/faris-sacrificing-to-baal-1891.jpg?w=230" class="rounded" style="width: 100%;">
	<p>Sacrificing to Baal. By Habib Faris, 1891.&nbsp; Colorized using <a href="http://colorize.ttic.edu/">Automatic Colorizer</a>.</p>
	<p>Deut 12:31 says the Canaanites "would even burn their sons and their daughters in
		the fire to their gods."
	</p>
</aside>
<p>In Gen 18:23-32, before God destroyed Sodom, he agreed he would spare the city if
	there were even ten innocent people within its walls, but not even ten could be
	found. This may imply Canaan was worse, and in several instances we're told about
	their immorality:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Amalekites "struck down all who lagged behind you" on
		Israel's migration out of Egypt. (Deut 25:18)</li>
	<li>Lev 18:24-30 informs us the inhabitants of Canaan "have defiled themselves"
		with incest of immediate family including children and grandchildren
		(verse 6-18), adultery (v20), human child sacrifice to the Amorite God Molech (v21),
		and bestiality (v23).</li>
	<li>Deut 12:31, "They [nations of Canaan] would even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods" </li>
	<li>Deut 18:9-10, "<span class="text Deut-18-9">you must
		not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations.&nbsp; </span>
		<span id="en-NRSV-5395" class="text Deut-18-10">No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire.</span>"</li>
	<li>Psalm 106:35, 37-38, "they [Israel] mingled with the nations and learned to
		do as they did... They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;&nbsp; they
		poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom
		they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan"</li>
	<li>Deut 9:4, "because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is dispossessing
		them before you."&nbsp; (this verse does not list specific immorality)</li>
	<li>2 Chron 28:3 explains that King Ahaz sacrificed his children by fire "according
		to the abominable practices of the nations whom the Lord drove out before the people
		of Israel."</li>
	<li>Gen 15:16, "the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."&nbsp; This
		was about 400 years prior to the conquest of Canaan, indicating they had been committing
		evil for a long time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oxford Old Testament historian John Day likewise attests:</p>

<blockquote>We have independent evidence that child sacrifice was practiced in the Canaanite (Carthaginian and Phoenician) world from many classical sources, Punic inscriptions and archaeological evidence, as well as Egyptian depictions of the ritual occurring in Syria-Palestine, and from a recently discovered Phoenician inscription in Turkey. There is therefore no reason to doubt the biblical testimony to Canaanite child sacrifice.[^day-2002]</blockquote>

<h3>Unprovoked Attacks on Israel</h3>
<p>The nations of Canaan attacked Israel first:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Amalekites attached Israel (Ex 17:8-9):&nbsp; "<span class="text Exod-17-8">Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.&nbsp; </span>Moses
		said to Joshua, 'Choose some men for us and go out, fight with Amalek.'”&nbsp; This
		was the first time the nation of Amalek is mentioned in the bible,
		indicating an unprovoked attack.</li>
	<li>So did king Arad of Canaan (Num 21:1):&nbsp; "When the Canaanite, the king of Arad,
		who lived in the Negeb, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he
		fought against Israel and took some of them captive."</li>
	<li>And King Sihon of the Amorites (Num 21:21-23):&nbsp; "Israel sent messengers to
		King Sihon of the Amorites, saying, 'Let me pass through your land; we will not
		turn aside into field or vineyard; we will not drink the water of any well; we
		will go by the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.'&nbsp; But
		Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all
		his people together, and went out against Israel to the wilderness; he came to
		Jahaz, and fought against Israel."</li>
	<li>As well as King Og of Bashan, an Amorite (Num 21:33):&nbsp; "King Og of Bashan came
		out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."</li>
	<li>The Moabites and Midianites hired Balaam to pronounce a curse on Israel in hopes
		"to defeat them and drive them from the land" (Num 22:6).&nbsp; When that didn't
		work, Balaam sent the Moabite women to seduce the Israelite men so they
		would violate the moral covenant they had entered with God. (Num 25:1, 31:16)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Repentance Preferred over Death</h3>
<p>Despite the Canaanite's immorality, elsewhere God indicates he prefers repentance
	to death:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ezekiel 18:31-32, "Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed
		against me, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die,
		O house of Israel?&nbsp; For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, says the
		Lord God. Turn, then, and live."</li>
	<li>Ezekiel 33:11, "As I live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of
		the wicked, but that the wicked turn from their ways and live"</li>
</ol>

<h2>Some conquest language was likely rhetorical</h2>

<h3>Meaning of the Hebrew Word "ban"</h3>
<p>The word translated as "destroy" or "annihilate" is Hebrew תחרימו (ban).
	&nbsp;Some scholars argue that the use of this word in ancient Israel's conquest
	language is non-literal.&nbsp; Richard Hess is a professor of Old Testament and
	Semitic Languages and worked on the translation committees for the NIV, NAB, and
	ESV.&nbsp; He states:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The above-mentioned herem ‘ban’ appears in Deut 20:10-18 as a guideline for Israel’s
		engagement with enemies on the territory that God had given to the nation. This
		“ban” required the total destruction of all warriors in the battle and (in some
		way) the consecration to Yahweh of everything that was captured. Niditch goes to
		some length to portray this activity as initially related to a sacrifice to God,
		part of a larger picture of human sacrifice.&nbsp; However, she writes that this
		changed: “The dominant voice in the Hebrew Bible treats the ban not as sacrifice
		in exchange for victory but as just and deserved punishment for idolaters, sinners,
		and those who lead Israel astray or commit direct injustice against Israel.”[^hess-2008]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that Hebrew תחרימו (ban):
	<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>means of describing something by detailing a "checklist" of what it could include
		(but not necessarily must include in every case). So the terms (and these are the
		only ones in Joshua) ‘men and women' (6:21; 8:25) and "young and old" (6:21) need
		not require that there really were children, senior citizens, or women there who
		were put to death.[^hess-2009]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hess also comments specifically on Joshua 6:21 "They annihilated with the sword...
	men and women, young and old:"</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>This text appears to include women, children, and the aged in this mass destruction.
		However, is this really the case? The actual expression is translated, “men and
		women,” literally, “from man (and) unto woman... Except for Saul’s extermination
		of the inhabitants of Nob in 1 Sam 22:19, where children are specifically mentioned
		(unlike the texts about Jericho, Ai, and elsewhere), all other appearances of the
		phrase precede or follow the Hebrew kol “all, everyone.” Thus, the phrase appears
		to be stereotypical for describing all the inhabitants of a town or region, without
		predisposing the reader to assume anything further about their ages or even their
		genders. It is synonymous with “all, everyone.”&nbsp; If Jericho was a fort, then
		the “all” who were slain in the Israelite attack would have been warriors.[^hess-2008c]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theologian Christopher J. H. Wright makes the same argument:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>We do need to allow for the exaggerated language of warfare.&nbsp; Israel, like
		other nations of the ancient Near East whose documents we posses, had a rhetoric
		of war that often exceeded reality on the ground.&nbsp; Even in the Old Testament
		itself this phenomenon is recognized and accepted.&nbsp; It is well known, for
		example, that the book of Joshua describes the conquest in rhetorically total terms--all
		the land is captured, all the kings are defeated, all the people without survivors
		are destroyed (e.g. Josh 10:40-42; 11:16-20).&nbsp; Yet the book of Judges (whose
		final editor must have been aware of these accounts in Joshua) sees no contradiction
		in telling us that the process of subduing the inhabitants of the land was far
		from completed and went on for some considerable time.&nbsp; So even in the Old
		Testament itself, rhetorical generalization is recognized for what it is.&nbsp; We
		need, therefore, in reading some of the more graphic descriptions, either of what
		was commanded to be done, or recorded as accomplished, to allow for this rhetorical
		element.&nbsp; This is not to accuse the biblical writers of falsehood, but to
		recognize the literary conventions of writing about warfare.[^wright-2004]
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our own English phrase "wipe the floor with them" doesn't mean to literally use people
	as mops.&nbsp; Should a non-native English speaker demand of us that a "baker's
	dozen" must be literally twelve?</p>
<p>It may be ethnocentric to require the same in the conquest narratives,
	and the following sections show how the positions of Hess and Wright find
	support in the text itself.</p>
<h3>Driving Out</h3>
<aside>

	</a>The Defiance of Goliath. A painting by James Tissot (1836-1902).
</aside>
<p>The conquest narratives describe how people of the Canaanite nations were completely
	destroyed, but also how they were forced to flee and live elsewhere. It's obviously
	not possible for a people group to be killed and also forced to move, which
	requires the annihilation language to be non-literal.&nbsp; Some examples:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Exodus 23:28-21:&nbsp; "I will send the pestilence in front of you, which shall <b>drive out</b> the
		Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from before you. I will not <b>drive them out</b> from
		before you in one year, or the land would become desolate... Little by little I
		will <b>drive them out</b> from before you, until you have increased and
		possess the land... I will hand over to you the inhabitants of the land, and you
		shall <b>drive them out</b> before you."
	</li>
	<li>Exodus 33:2:&nbsp; "I will <b>drive out</b> the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites,
		the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
	</li>
	<li>Exodus 34:11:&nbsp; I will <b>drive</b>
		<b>out</b> before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites,
		the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
	</li>
	<li>Leviticus 18:24 says the nations will be driven out: "Do not defile yourselves in
		any of these ways, for by all these practices the nations I am <b>casting out</b> before
		you have defiled themselves."</li>
	<li>Numbers 21:32-32 talks of dispossession: "Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
		Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they captured its villages, and <b>dispossessed</b> the
		Amorites who were there."</li>
	<li>In Numbers 33:51-53 God told Moses: "When you cross over the Jordan into
		the land of Canaan,&nbsp; you shall <b>drive out</b> all the inhabitants
		of the land from before you, destroy all their figured stones, destroy all their
		cast images, and demolish all their high places.&nbsp; You shall take possession
		of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess."
	</li>
	<li>Deut 6:18-19: "Do what is right... so that you may go in and occupy the good land
		that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give you, <b>thrusting out</b> all
		your enemies from before you, as the Lord has promised."&nbsp; Many other translations
		use "drive out."</li>
	<li>Deut 7:2 says to "utterly destroy" the seven nations of Canaan, and most other
		translations say to utterly or completely destroy them.&nbsp; But verse 5 gives
		more detail as to what this means:&nbsp; "break down their altars, smash their
		pillars, hew down their sacred poles, and burn their idols with fire."</li>
	<li>Deut 7:22 specifically says that Israel was forbidden to "make a quick end of them"
		and instead they would be expelled "little by little."</li>
	<li>Deut 9:4 tells us the goal was to dispossess:&nbsp; "it is rather because of the
		wickedness of these nations that the Lord is <b>dispossessing</b> them
		before you."</li>
	<li>Deut 11:23: "the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> will <b>drive</b>
		<b> out</b> all these nations before you"
	</li>
	<li>Deut 18:12, "whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lord; it is because of
		such abhorrent practices that the Lord your God is <b>driving them out</b> before
		you."
	</li>
	<li>In Joshua 3:10, Joshua says "God who without fail will <b>drive out</b> from
		before you" the seven nations of Canaan.</li>
	<li>Joshua 23:9, "the Lord has <b>driven out</b> before you great and strong
		nations; and as for you, no one has been able to withstand you to this day.&nbsp; One
		of you <b>puts to flight</b> a thousand"</li>
	<li>1 Kings 21:26 speaks of "the Amorites... the Lord <b>drove out</b> before
		the Israelites."</li>		
	<li>Jewish to Christian convert Stephen likewise interpreted that Joshua
		 "dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors." (Acts 7:45)</li>
</ol>

<p>These are same nations that previously were "utterly destroyed" (Deut 7:2) but
	their inhabitants still existed to be driven out.
</p>
<p>In support, Jeremiah 4:29 suggests the inhabitants ancient near east cities fled
	when armies approached: "At the noise of horseman and archer every town takes to flight; 
	they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; all the towns are forsaken, and no one lives in them."</p>
	
<h4>Other Ancient Rhetoric</h4>

<p>Egyptian Pharoah Rameses III used similar language:</p>

<blockquote>"I slew the Denyon in their islands, while the Tjekker and Philistines 
were made ashes. The Sherden and the Washesh of the sea were made non-existent, 
captured all together and brought on captivity to Egypt like the sands of the shore."[^barako-2013]</blockquote>

<aside>A scene from "Bulding Pharoah's Chariots" on PBS Nova.</aside>
<img src="ancient-israel-morality-of-the-conquest-of-canaan-files/building-pharaohs-chariot.jpg?w=1000" style="width: 100%">

<p>If the  Sherden and the Washesh were litereally made "nonexistent" they couldn't then be taken to Egypt in captivity.</p>

<p>Likewise Jesus used overstatement in Luke 14:26, "Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple."</p>


<h3>Do not interact with those who were "destroyed"</h3>
<p>If the Canaanites were completely destroyed, there would be no need for subsequent
	commands forbidding specific types of interactions with them:</p>
<p>Deut 12:29-31, "When the Lord your
	God has cut off before you the nations whom you are about to enter to dispossess
	them, when you have dispossessed them and live in their land,
	take care that you are not snared into imitating them, after they have been destroyed
		before you...&nbsp; They would even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods."
</p>
<p>Either the author of Deuteronomy was blind even to contradictions within a single
	sentence, or commands for total destruction were understood rhetorically.</p>

<h3>Annihilation is Contradictory</h3>
<p>Several times after a people group is "completely destroyed", "put to the sword",
	and even every "man, woman, child, infant" put to death, they show up again later
	(surprise!) seemingly unaware that they no longer exist.&nbsp; If we interpreted
	this destruction literally, it creates immediate contradictions in the text.&nbsp; Thus
	a non-literal interpretation makes sense:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Judges 1:8, "the people of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it. They put it to the sword and set the city on fire.",
		but verse 21 says that afterward some were still living there: "The Benjaminites
		did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived
		in Jerusalem among the Benjaminites to this day."&nbsp; </li>
	<li>Joshua 23:12-13: "if you turn back, and join the survivors of these nations left
		here among you, and intermarry with them, so that you marry their women and they
		yours, know assuredly that the Lord your God will not continue to drive out these
		nations before you; but they shall be a snare and a trap for you..."</li>
	<li>In 1 Sam 15:2-4 we read, "‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did in opposing
		the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.&nbsp; Now go and attack Amalek,
		and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and
		woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey."&nbsp; In 15:8 we read
		that Saul "utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword" and in
		15:33 "Samuel hewed Agag in pieces."&nbsp; However the Amalekites show up again
		later in 1 Sam 27:8 and King David leaves "neither man nor woman alive."&nbsp; But they're alive again in 30:1-18, in 1 Chron 4:43 during the reign of Hezekiah,
		and even 500 years later in Esther 3:1 (Haman was an Agagite, a descendant
		of the Amalekite king Agag). This means Agag's people were not literally "utterly
		destroyed" and the language must be non-literal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, consider that the Canaanites were condemned for killing their children by
	fire for sacrifices. (Lev 18:24-30, Deut 12:31, Deut 18:9-10, 2 Chron 28:3)&nbsp; It
	would be inconsistent if Israel was then commanded to prevent and avenge child
	sacrifice by killing the children who were to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>In some cases enemies were assimilated into Israel.</p>
<ol>
	<li>More distant cities were to be given an option for surrender and assimilation.&nbsp; Deut
		20:10-11, "When you draw near to a town to fight against it, offer it terms of
		peace. If it accepts your terms of peace and surrenders to you, then all the people
		in it shall serve you at forced labor."&nbsp; If they refused, only the men were
		to be killed. (verse 14)</li>
	<li>Joshua 6:17 tells us that Rahab was given a choice to join Israel even though
		her city was marked for destruction: "The city and all that is in it shall be devoted to the
		<span class="small-caps">Lord</span> for destruction. Only
		Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live because she
		hid the messengers we sent."</li>
	<li>Leviticus 19:34 goes even further to suggest how instances of integration should
		proceed: "the alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you;
		you shall love the alien as yourself."</li>
	<li>Although written perhaps 400 years later, Zechariah 9:6-7 also describes an instance
		of foreigners being integrated into Israel: "a mongrel people shall settle in Ashdod, and
		I will make an end of the pride of Philistia.&nbsp; I will take away its blood
		from its mouth, and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall
		be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah."</li>
</ol>

<h3>Dishonest Embellishment or Historical Revisionism?</h3>
<p>Was conquest language embellishment in order to impress readers?&nbsp; This is unlikely,
	considering how much the same text records Israel failing miserably and God no longer
	supporting them due to their own morality.&nbsp; Any historical revisionist with
	this goal would surely also remove embarrassing verses like Numbers 14:43:
</p>
<blockquote>
	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you will fall by
	the sword. Because you have turned away from the Lord, the Lord will not be with
	you.
</blockquote>

<p>Or Jeremiah 25:9 where the "utterly destroy" language was used against Israel itself:</p>

<blockquote>I will utterly destroy them [Israel], and make them an 
object of horror and of hissing, and an everlasting disgrace.</blockquote>
<p>Yet in verse 11 we see the people themselves are not destroyed but will "serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
And  not all were even taken:  "Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time." (Jer 39:10)</p>

<h2>Most conquered cities were likely military outposts</h2>

<p>In the book of Joshua, the destruction of Jericho is described in more detail than
	any other city, so it is fruitful to examine it in detail.&nbsp; Richard Hess
	provides
	several lines of evidence that most cities ordered to be destroyed were likely military bases rather than populated cities:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Jericho and Ai, the initial two sites of conquest, instead of being towns or cities,
		may have been military forts guarding the routes from the Jordan Valley up to population
		centers in the hill country such as Bethel and Jerusalem. Evidence for this conclusion
		includes:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>the complete absence of references to specific noncombatants such as women and
			children with the exception of Rahab and her family, who are not killed;</li>
		<li>the lack of evidence for settlement at Jericho and Ai during the time of Israel’s
			emergence in Canaan, suggesting that these were not cities but military forts;</li>
		<li>the use of the term melek ‘king’ [Joshua 2:2, <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/strong.php?id=04428">Hebrew מלכי</a>]
			to mean a military leader in Canaan at this time;</li>
		<li>the lack of indication in the biblical text that these were large cities (unlike
			Gibeon and Hazor, which are thus described); and</li>
		<li>the meaning of the name Ai ‘ruin’, which suggests the reuse of earlier fortifications
			to serve as a temporary fort instead of a more permanent site of habitation. </li>
	</ol>

	<p>The other two major battles, which were against the northern and southern coalitions,
		are represented in the biblical text as defensive wars (Joshua 10–11).&nbsp; In
		both cases, they begin as the coalitions assemble against Israel or its ally and
		therefore force the people of God into battle (Josh 10:3–5, 11:1–5). Note, furthermore,
		that the eight or more references to complete destruction of the cities represented
		by these coalitions (in which nothing was left alive) could plausibly be stereotypical
		descriptions for the purpose of demonstrating obedience to the command to drive
		out the Canaanites (Josh 10:28, 30, 32, 35, 37, 39; 11:11, 14).&nbsp; It is possible
		that, after the defeat of the army, the populations fled rather than remaining
		in a relatively defenseless city. Furthermore, we know that many of these “cities”
		were used primarily for government buildings, and the common people lived in the
		surrounding countryside.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not certain that there was a population
		remaining in these cities to be destroyed. There is no indication in the text of
		any specific noncombatants who were put to death. In any case, there is clear evidence
		that there were Canaanites remaining in the areas where Israel settled (Judges
		2:10–13)....
	</p>

	<p>Does this mean that biblical Israel never killed anyone unjustly? Certainly not.
		The wars recorded in Judges become increasingly brutal, until the final chapters
		depict a civil war with killing that resembles a massacre. However, as in other
		descriptions of battles in the Bible, there is no suggestion in Judges that these
		wars and atrocities reflected the ideal that Israel was expected to follow in obedience
		to its God, the true warrior. The same can be said of later battles, including
		the campaigns of David (especially after he became king); they are not held up
		as an ideal to emulate.</p>
	<p>I must emphasize that we must always preserve the distinction between a record
		of what happened, or at least a story about it, and a moral evaluation of the account.
		To highlight this distinction, the biblical writer may stress, for example,
		the peaceful and defenseless nature of the city of Laish that the tribe of
		Dan attacks (Judg 18:7–10, 27–29). However, it is wrong to argue that the writer
		of the account “sees this as divine providence,”... The writer nowhere makes
		this claim. Instead, it is reported that the tribe of Dan determines that
		God has given the city into their hands. Whether this is true or not and whether
		they have any right to murder the innocents in the city are points not discussed.
		This is characteristic of the writers of Judges who, especially in the final
		chapters, record events and dialogue but leave moral and theological evaluations
		to the readers... Like the writers of Judges, the composers of the books of
		Samuel often reserved judgment and merely described the events. Plenty of criticism of David’s
		ethics is placed in the mouths of Nathan the prophet and others, but it is part
		of the narrative and not a task of the narrator.[^hess-2008b]</p>

</aside>

<p>Elsewhere[^hess-2008d] Hess goes into extensive detail defending the melek
	"king" being a military leader.</p>
<p>Additional reasons to suspect Jericho may have been a military outpost:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Jericho was small enough that Israel was able to circle it seven times
		in one day (Joshua 6:4, presumably out of the range of bow and sling) and still
		do battle with it before dark.</li>
	<li>"Jericho is situated at the beginning of several of the main roads that run from
		the Jordan Valley into the central hill country... this suggests a strategic value
		for Jericho that would encourage a military presence there."[^hess-2008e]
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Destruction of Ai</h3>
<p>It was here that Israel had put the inhabitants of Ai to the sword, "twelve thousand—all
	the people of Ai." (Joshua 8:24-25)&nbsp; Ai was more likely a military fort
	than a city:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>the textual picture of Ai remains surprisingly similar to the picture of Jericho.
		Like Jericho, the author identiﬁes Ai as an ºîr [as opposed to ºîr gédôlâ, the
		"great city" as Gibeon is described]. Here as well, it was probably not what
		modern people would consider to be a city but was more likely a fort... Like Jericho,
		Ai also had a melek [king], walls, an army, and no speciﬁc mention of noncombatants.[^hess-2008f]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the language is ambiguous as to whether 12,000 were killed:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The Hebrew for “thousand” is aelep. An aelep can refer to a clan or a military unit,
		as well as 1,000 individuals. In Num 31:5 it is translated by the NIV as “clans”
		[^hess-2008g]
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Gibeon and Hazor were populated cities</h3>
<p>However, Gibeon and Hazor seem not to be just military outposts.&nbsp; "Gibeon is
	described as 'a great city' (Josh 10:2), and Hazor is placed at 'the head of all
	these kingdoms' (Josh 11:10)."[^hess-2008e]&nbsp; Joshua 11:11 records, "they put to the sword all who were in it, utterly destroying them; there was no one left who breathed,"
	but 11:19 tells us that Gibeon made peace with Israel, suggesting that option was
	available to the others as well.</p>

<h2>The Need for Wrathfulness</h2>
<p>It's not possible to have a just God without wrath, otherwise those who do wrong
	receive no punishment.&nbsp; Croatian theologian Miroslav Volf expounds on this
	idea:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I used to think that wrath was unworthy of God. Isn't God love? Shouldn't divine
		love be beyond wrath? God is love, and God loves every person and every creature.
		That’s exactly why God is wrathful against some of them. My last resistance to
		the idea of God’s wrath was a casualty of the war in the former Yugoslavia, the
		region from which I come. According to some estimates, 200,000 people were killed
		and over 3,000,000 were displaced. My villages and cities were destroyed, my people
		shelled day in and day out, some of them brutalized beyond imagination, and I could
		not imagine God not being angry. Or think of Rwanda in the last decade of the past
		century, where 800,000 people were hacked to death in one hundred days! How did
		God react to the carnage? By doting on the perpetrators in a grandparently fashion?
		By refusing to condemn the bloodbath but instead affirming the perpetrators’ basic
		goodness? Wasn't God fiercely angry with them? Though I used to complain about
		the indecency of the idea of God’s wrath, I came to think that I would have to
		rebel against a God who wasn't wrathful at the sight of the world’s evil. God isn't
		wrathful in spite of being love. God is wrathful because God is love.[^volf-2009]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This highlights an inconsistency among critics of Christianity.&nbsp; The well-known
	paranormal investigator and atheist James Randi once wrote in Skeptic Magazine,
	"I accuse the Christian god of murder by allowing the Holocaust to take place."[^randi-1995]
	&nbsp;But in the beginning of this article atheists like Christopher Hitchens and
	Richard Dawkins condemn God's judgment against the Canaanites.</p>

<h3>Unapproved warfare and violence is condemned</h3>
<p>Much of the Hebrew Old Testament is a history of what is, rather than what ought
	to be.&nbsp; Many cases of violence were simply committed by violent men, never
	condoned, and often condemned by God.&nbsp; Two examples:</p>
<h4>Genesis 34</h4>
<p>Genesis 34:2-4, 8, 13-16, and 25-30 describes how in retribution for their raped sister, Simeon and Levi attacked and
	killed every male in a city, taking their women captive.&nbsp; Yet in addition to condemnation from their father Jacob (34:30), Joseph
	also condemned his brothers' actions, cursing them for their violent retribution
	for their sister Dinah's rape.&nbsp; Genesis 49:5-7:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><span id="en-NRSV-1479" class="text Gen-49-5">Simeon and Levi are brothers; </span>
		<span class="indent-1"><span class="text Gen-49-5">weapons of violence are their swords.<span style="font-size: 11.305px;">&nbsp; </span></span>
		</span><span id="en-NRSV-1480" class="text Gen-49-6">May I never come into their council; </span>
		<span class="indent-1"><span class="text Gen-49-6">may I not be joined to their company—</span></span>
		<span class="text Gen-49-6">for in their anger they killed men, </span>
		<span class="indent-1"><span class="text Gen-49-6">and at their whim they hamstrung oxen.&nbsp; </span></span>
		<span id="en-NRSV-1481" class="text Gen-49-7">Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, </span>
		<span class="indent-1"><span class="text Gen-49-7">and their wrath, for it is cruel!&nbsp; I</span></span>
		<span class="text Gen-49-7"> will divide them in Jacob, </span>
		<span class="indent-1"><span class="text Gen-49-7">and scatter them in Israel.</span></span>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>2 Kings 10:1-36</h4>
<p>2 Kings 10:1-36 describes how Jehu killed the wicked king Ahab's entire family as
	well as the prophets and priests of Baal.&nbsp; But Hosea 1:4-5 casts condemnation
	on Jehu from the Lord:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><span id="en-NRSV-22099" class="text Hos-1-4">the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said
		to him, “Name him Jezreel; for in a little while I will punish
		the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom
		of the house of Israel. </span><span id="en-NRSV-22100" class="text Hos-1-5">On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Difficult Verses</h2>


<h3>Numbers 31</h3>
<p>Why was Moses furious they let the women live and ordered any who had slept with
	a man were killed?&nbsp; In this passage, critics suggest that the Israelites were
	taking sex slaves for themselves.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The backstory is key. The Moabites and Midianites had hired Balaam to say a curse
	against Israel, so that they may conquer them and drive them away.&nbsp; Numbers
	22:4-6:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><span id="en-NRSV-4380" class="text Num-22-4">Moab said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. <span style="font-size: 11.305px;"> </span></span>
		<span id="en-NRSV-4381" class="text Num-22-5">He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is on the Euphrates,
			in the land of Amaw, to summon him, saying, “A people
		has come out of Egypt; they have spread over the face of the earth, and they have
		settled next to me.&nbsp; </span><span id="en-NRSV-4382" class="text Num-22-6">Come now, curse this people for me, since they are stronger than I; perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land; for I know that whomever you bless is blessed, and whomever you curse is cursed.”</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In chapters 22-24, God instead forces Balaam to pronounce a blessing on Israel,
	and Balaam is dismissed without pay by king Balak of Moab.&nbsp; In Numbers 23:29
	Balaam was told God is not "a mortal, that he should change his mind," but perhaps
	Balaam could change the Israelites instead.&nbsp;  It's possible he even realized
	that Israel would be cursed if they disobeyed God's commands (Deutt 28:15-68).&nbsp;
	Balaam therefore enacted a more effective strategy against Israel--dereliction
	through the enticement and seduction of women:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Numbers 25:1, "While Israel was staying at Shittim, the people began to have sexual
		relations with the women of Moab."</li>
	<li>Numbers 31:16, "These women here, on Balaam’s advice, made the Israelites act treacherously
		against the Lord in the affair of Peor, so that the plague came among the congregation
		of the Lord."</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>After the Israelites defeated Midian and Moab in battle, this is why Moses was particularly
	adamant that these women--employed by an enemy nation to seduce and thus compromise
	the men of Israel--were put to death (Numbers 31). Therefore the women who had "not
	had sexual intercourse with a man" would be the ones not among the seductionists
	sent by Midian and Moab.</p>
<p>Additionally, It makes very little sense that the remaining women would have been
	taken as sex slaves, since Moses had previously ordered the execution of any men
	who had slept with them in Numbers 25:5.&nbsp; The idea of prisoners taken as sex
	slaves is also inconsistent with the many other laws against sexual immorality:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Lev 19:20 commands that if a master has sexual relations with a slave engaged to

<h3>Deuteronomy 21:10-14</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p><span class="text Deut-21-10">When you go out to war against your enemies, and the
		<span class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God hands them over
		to you and you take them captive,
		 </span><span id="en-NRSV-5459" class="text Deut-21-11"><sup class="versenum"> </sup>suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman whom you desire and want to marry, </span>

		<span id="en-NRSV-5461" class="text Deut-21-13">discard her captive’s garb, and shall remain in your house a full month, mourning
					for her father and mother; after that you may go in to her and be her husband,
					and she shall be your wife. <span style="font-size: 11.305px;"> </span></span>
		<span id="en-NRSV-5462" class="text Deut-21-14">But if you are not satisfied with her, you shall let her go free and not sell
					her for money. You must not treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored
					her.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This forbids men to rape women during war, and a woman could not be both a slave
	and subject to sexual relations. Either she became a wife after a waiting period,
	or she was to be set free.&nbsp; Cutting hair and nails was likely related to mourning.

<p>While Copan and Rauser offered valid points, perhaps both carry their arguments
	too far and often talked past one another.&nbsp; Richard Hess is somewhat more balanced
	and primarily presents the historical context rather than taking a philosophical
	angle.&nbsp; Lydia McGrew's article is the best rebuttal to the stance of Hess
	and especially Copan, and is also the best rebuttal to the position I take in this
	article.
