# Chronology of Christ

## Summary

Jesus likely began his ministry in 29 the second half of AD and was crucified on April 3, 33 AD.  The date of Jesus birth will be discussed in a future version of this article.

### 29 AD Ministry Start

The table below shows why 29 AD is the most likely date for Jesus beginning his ministry.  Many of these are based on the date with John the Baptist began his ministry, and Luke 3:1-22 puts that very close to when Jesus began.

| Event                                                        | Date                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Pilate** was governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD, and was governor when John the Baptist began ministry, according to Luke 3:1 | 26 - 36 AD                          |
| **Herod Antipas** was Tetrarch of Galilee from 20 AD to 39 AD, and also when John began his ministry (Luke 3:1). | < 39                                |
| **Philip**, brother of Herod Antipas, was Tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis from 4 BC to 34 AD, and also when John's ministry began (Luke 3:1). | < 34                                |
| **Annas and Caiaphas** were high priests when John's ministry began (Luke 3:1).  Caiaphas was high priest from 18 to 36 AD. | 18 - 36                             |
| **Tiberius** became Emperor in 14 AD (not 11 AD as some suppose[^hoehner-1978:e]).  Jesus began his ministry in the 15th year of Tiberius, per Luke 3:1, which was from around the fall of 28 AD to Spring of 30 AD, depending on the system of reckoning.[^maier-1968:a] [^josephus-93:a] [^britannica-tiberius] [^humphreys-2011:a] | Fall of 28 AD to Spring of 30 AD    |
| **About 30 Years Old** Luke 3:23 says Jesus "was about thirty years old" when "he began his ministry." | ~27-30                              |
| **The Temple** had been "been under construction for forty-six years" when Jesus attended the Passover (in springtime) in John 2:20.  The temple began construction in 17 or 16 BC, and 46 years later is 28 to 29 AD. | 24 to 29 AD or possibly 32 to 36 AD |

Above, Luke 3:1 gives us perhaps the earliest unambiguous date based on John the Baptist beginning ministry in Aug 28 to Aug 29 AD.

### 3 Year Ministry Length

Jesus' ministry likely lasted a little over 3 years, because the Gospel of John records three Passovers (John 2:3, 6:4, 11:55) and implies a fourth by saying "the fields are already white for harvest" in John 4:35, which is Passover time, followed by an unknown, non-Passover feast in John 5:1.

### Crucifixion

All four gospels say Jesus was crucified on Passover, which was also the day of preparation (Friday) that occurred before the Sabbath.[^josephus-93:e] [^hoehner-1978:k]  The Jews had no concept of a Sabbath on any day other than Saturday.[^hoehner-1978:i]  The table below shows why 33 AD is the most likely crucifixion date:

| Event                                                        | Dates                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Pilate** was still governor of Judea when Jesus was crucified, per Luke 3:1, Josephus,[^josephus-93:h] and Tacitus.[^tacitus-116:a] | 26 - 36                                    |
| **Herod Antipas** was involved in the trial leading to the crucifixion (Luke 23:7), but was deposed in 39 AD. | Before 39                                  |
| **Sejanus was executed** in October 18, 31 AD.  Afterward, Tiberius reversed the anti-Jewish policies of Sejanus and began going after those close to him.  This gives weight to the Jews' threat, "If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar!" in John 19:12. | After Oct 18, 31                           |
| **Passover** was on a Friday only in 30 and 33 AD, but not the surrounding years.[^maier-1968:b] | Friday, April 7, 30 or Friday, April 3, 33 |
| **The duration of Jesus' ministry** of just over 3 years ends on Passover (early spring) of 32 or 33 AD, based on the 29AD start date above. | 32 or 33                                   |
| A **Partial Lunar Eclipse** occurred at moonrise of Passover on April 3, 33 AD,[^nasa-2006] matching Peter's quote of Joel 2:31 "the sunlight will be turned to darkness and the moon to the color of blood" in Acts 2. | April 3, 33                                |
| An **Earthquake** happened at the crucifixion per Matthew 27:50-54 and the Greek historian Phlegon,[^eusebius-chronicon] and at the resurrection per Matthew 28:2.  Dead Sea varves indicate an earthquake in 31 AD ± 5 years.[^williams-2011:a] | 26 to 36                                   |
| **The Talmud** says the Jewish Sanhedrin lost their ability to give capital punishment "40 years before the temple was destroyed"[^babylonian-talmud:g] in 70 AD, explaining why they had Pilate to sentence Jesus to death in John 18:31. | In or after 30                             |
| **The Talmud** says the Jews saw multiple bad omens in the temple beginning "40 years before the temple was destroyed,"[^babylonian-talmud:d] [^babylonian-talmud:e] in 70 AD, which perhaps started either when Jesus' ministry began or at the crucifixion. | 30 or 33                                   |
| **Phlegon** says Jesus was crucified in fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad.[^eusebius-chronicon] | 33                                         |

April 3, 33 AD is the most compatible date for the crucifixion given all the data above, and is only contradicted by some of the dates estimated by writers after 200 AD.

## Birth

It's generally believed that Jesus was born between 7 Bc and 1 BC.  This section will be expanded later.

==Eusebius](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250101.htm):  It was in the forty-second year of the reign of Augustus and the twenty-eighth after the subjugation of Egypt and the death of Antony and Cleopatra, with whom the dynasty of the Ptolemies in Egypt came to an end, that our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judea.==

=="An early church tradition (from the anonymous 4th-century On Solstices and Equinoxes https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/tag/de-solstitia/ ) states that Jesus was crucified on the same day He was conceived in the womb."==

## 29 AD Start of Ministry

### 15th Year of Tiberius

The Roman Emperor Tiberius was co-emperor with Augustus from 11 to 14 AD but everyone in the ancient world counted his reign as beginning in 14 AD.  Luke 3:1 says John the Baptist's ministry started in the 15th year of Tiberius, which was most likely from Fall of 28 AD to Spring of 30 AD, depending on the system of reckoning:[^hoehner-1978:d] [^humphreys-2011:a]

| System                    | 15th Year of Tiberius        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Roman Julian Calendar     | Jan 1 to Dec 31, 29 AD       |
| Jewish Religious Calendar | Spring 29 AD to spring 30 AD |
| Jewish Civil calendar     | Fall 28 AD to Fall 29 AD     |

Since Luke was addressing Theophilus, a Roman name, the Roman system of reckoning is perhaps most likely.[^hoehner-1978:d] [^humphreys-2011:a]

John 1 presents Jesus beginning his ministry not long after John the Baptist.  In John 1:19,  "the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem" to find out who John the Baptist was, which would likely be close to when John started his ministry.  Then "On the next day" (John 1:29) John the Baptist meets Jesus and baptizes him, starting Jesus' ministry.

### 46 Years to Build the Temple

In John 2:20b, Jesus is challenged:

> Then the Jewish leaders said to him, “This temple has been under construction for years, and are you going to raise it up in three days?"

Josephus says that construction began on the temple in either Herod the Great's 15th year[^josephus-75:a] (Nisan 23 to Nisan 22 BC) or during or shortly after Herod's 18th year[^josephus-93:b] [^josephus-93:c] (Nisan 20 to Nisan 19 BC).[^hoehner-1978:b]

Josephus says the "the temple it self was built by the priests in a year and six months,"[^josephus-93:d] and the outer courtyard was built in 8 years.[^josephus-93:g]  John 2:20 says in most English translations, "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years,"[^biblehub:a] but it could also be translated as "this temple was built forty-six years ago."[^biblegateway:a]  That fits the context of John 2 less naturally but it better fits Josephus saying the temple would've been finished long ago.  This gives us a wide range of interpretations:

| #    | Reckoning                                                    | Time of John 2:20   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1    | Mar 23 to Mar 22 BC + 46 years construction                  | Mar 24 to Mar 25 AD |
| 2    | Mar 23 to Mar  22 BC + 1.5 years construction + 46 years finished | Sep 25 to Sep 26 AD |
| 3    | Mar 23 to Mar 22 BC + 8 years construction + 46 years finished | Mar 32 to Mar 33 AD |
| 4    | Mar 20 to Mar 19 BC + 46 years construction                  | Mar 27 to Mar 28 AD |
| 5    | Mar 20 to Mar 19 BC + 1.5 years construction + 46 years finished | Sep 28 to Sep 29 AD |
| 6    | Mar 20 to Mar 19 BC + 8 years construction + 46 years finished | Mar 35 to Mar 36 AD |

Depending on how we calculate this we can get any year between 24 and 29 AD and 32 to 36 AD.  However, the Greek word for temple used in John 2:20 is literally "edifice" which fits best with the 1.5 years of construction on the temple itself, not the 8 years of construction for the courtyard,[^hoehner-1978:c] ruling out reckonings #3 and #6.

### About 30 years Old

Luke 3:23 says "Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years old."  But to make use of this number we need to know when Jesus was born, and that will be added in a future version of this article.

### Early Writers

This is not a complete list of early perspectives and may be expanded in the future.

#### Eusebius:  29 AD

Around perhaps the year 313 AD, Christian historian Eusebius cites Luke 3:1 that it was the 15th year of Tiberius and the fourth year of Pontius Pilate when Jesus was baptized: 

> It was in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, according to the evangelist [Luke], and in the fourth year of the governorship of Pontius Pilate, while Herod and Lysanias and Philip were ruling the rest of Judea, that our Saviour and Lord, Jesus the Christ of God, being about thirty years of age, came to John for baptism and began the promulgation of the Gospel.[^eusebius-313:a]

And elsewhere Eusebius says:

>  Pilate was made procurator of Judea by Tiberius in the twelfth year of his reign.[^eusebius-313:b]

While Tiberius's 15th year was from August 28 to 29 AD, Pilate likely became governor in 26 or 27 AD, making his fourth year in 30 or 31 AD.

## Three Year Duration of Ministry

### Four Passovers in the Gospels

Based on these events mentioned in the Gospels, Jesus ministry spanned a little more than three years, involving four Passovers,[^maier-1968:e] with some time before the first Passover.  These passages in the gospels have clues relating events to the time of year:

1. Prior to Jesus' first Passover was Jesus' baptism (Mark 1:13-17, Matthew 3:13-17, Luke 3:21-22, John 1:29-31), the 40 day temptation in the desert (Matthew 4:1-11, Mark 1:12-13, Luke 4:1-13), the calling of the first disciples (Matthew 5:18-22, John 1:43-51), the Wedding at Cana (John 2:1-11), and the Journey to Capernaum (John 1:12-22).
2. John 2:3, the **first Passover** during Jesus' ministry:  "Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem."  Passover is usually around April.
3. John 4:35, When Jesus met the woman at the well, "Don't you say, there are four more months and then comes the harvest?"  There's no evidence that "four more months..." was a common saying,[^hoehner-1978:g] and there were six months between sowing grains in October/November and harvest in March/April, not four.[^hoehner-1978:f] [^mishna:a] [^jewish-calendar]  Assuming Jesus met the woman at the well four months before harvest, this would've happened around January/February.
4. In Matthew 12:1, Mark 2:23, and Luke 6:1 the discipled picked fully ripened grain, and grain ripens in Jerusalem in Spring.  This happened during an unknown year, but John 4:35 mentions that "the fields are already white for harvest," which would be very near the second Passover of Jesus' ministry.
5. John 5:1 then mentions a feast but doesn't say which one: "After this there was a Jewish feast,and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."  John calls the Passover by its name in 2:23, 2:23, 6:4, 11:55, 12:, 13:1, 18:39, and 19:14 so this is unlikely the Passover.  It might Pentecost in May, or be the Feast of Tabernacles in September/October, since John calls it "the feast" in 7:2, 7:10, 7:14, and 7:37.  If so, this means the second Passover of Jesus' ministry happened between 4:35 and 5:1, but was not recorded.  Otherwise, this unknown feast was Jesus' second Passover.  Either way, a **second Passover** has occurred.
6. John 6:4, at the feeding of the 5000:  "Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near."  Mark 6:39 likewise mentions there being "green grass" at this time.  This was Jesus' **third Passover**.
7. John 7:2, "Now the Jewish Feast of Shelters [Tabernacles] was near" in September/October.
8. John 10:22, "Then came the feast of the Dedication [Hannukah, in December] in Jerusalem.  It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico."  This might correspond to when "Jesus set out resolutely to go to Jerusalem." in Luke 9:51.
9. In John 11:7-17, Jesus returned to Jerusalem for the funeral of Lazarus.  This could possibly correspond with the same trip in Luke 13:31-33, "some Pharisees came up and said to Jesus, 'Get away from here, because Herod wants to kill you.  But he said to them '.... I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, because it is impossible that a prophet should be killed outside Jerusalem.'"
10. In John 11:55, "Now the Jewish Feast of Passover was near."  This was the Passover of the crucifixion--Jesus' **fourth and final Passover**.  This could possibly correspond with Jesus' trip to Jerusalem in Luke 17:11.  And going to "the region of Judea" in Matthew 19:1 and Mark 10:1.

### Early Writers

Early writers had a wide range of estimates for the duration of Jesus' ministry, and perhaps are not very helpful.

#### Tertullian:  1 Year

Around the year 200 AD, Christian writer Tertullian suggested Jesus ministry was only one year, since he says Jesus died in the 15th year of Tiberius.[^mosshammer-2008:a]

#### Clement of Alexandria:  1 Year

Clement of Alexandria wrote around the year 200 AD that Jesus preached "only a year."

> And that it was necessary for Him to preach only a year, this also is written: He has sent Me to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.  https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02101.htm

#### Eusebius:  3-4 Years

Around perhaps the year 313 AD, Christian historian Eusebius estimated that Jesus' ministry lasted 3-4 years.

> Since he began his work during the high priesthood of Annas and taught until Caiaphas held the office, the entire time does not comprise quite four years.[^eusebius-313:a]

This is not an exhaustive list of early writers and may be expanded in the future.

## Friday Passover Crucifixion

A Friday crucifixion is the common consensus of the Church fathers, scholars throughout history, and scholars today.[^hoehner-1978:l]  However let's examine why this is the case.

### The week before Passover

1. **Saturday**
    1. John 12:1-9 says "six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany."  He has dinner with Lazarus, Mary, and Martha, with Martha serving.  Mary anoints Jesus' feet with oil, and Judas complains that the oil should've been sold.  A large crowd comes to see Jesus and Lazarus.  The chief priests plan to kill Lazarus.
2. **Sunday**
    1. John 1:12-13 says the Triumphal Entry was the next day, AKA Palm Sunday.  A "large crowd that had come to the feast" brought palm branches to meet Jesus, shouting "Hosanna!"  Jesus rides on a donkey on his way into Jerusalem
    2. Mark 11:1-11 describes the same event and says Jesus went back to Bethany late that night with the disciples.
3. **Monday**
    1. Mark 11:12-14 says "the next day, as they went out from Bethany" Jesus cursed a fig tree.
    2. Mark 11:15-19 describes Jesus coming to the temple area and turning over the tables of the money changers.  "When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city."
4. **Tuesday**
    1. Mark 11:20-21 says "In the morning" Peter pointed out "the fig tree you cursed has withered" and 11:27 says "they came again to Jerusalem." In Mark 11:27 to 13:37, the Pharisees question Jesus' authority and Jesus gives many teachings.
5. **Wednesday**
    1. Mark 14:1 says it was now "two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread."  Mark 14:3-11 describes Jesus visiting Simon the leper where a woman pours expensive oil on Jesus, and some present complain about the cost.  Judas meets with the chief priests to betray Jesus.
6. Thursday ==TODO==

### Jesus dies on the Eve of Passover

==TODO sort out Passover vs Passover Eve==

These statements indicate Jesus died on Passover Eve:

- John 13:1-2 "Just before the Passover Feast, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father... The evening meal was in progress."  John 13-18 indicates Jesus' betrayal, arrest, trial, and crucifixion occurred immediately after this and into the next day.
- In 1 Corinthians 5:7, Paul wrote, "...Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed."
- In 1 Corinthians 15:20, Paul wrote, "...Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."  Firstfruits occurred on Nisan 16 (Lev 23:11).  Jesus rose from the dead on "the first day of the week" (Mark 16:2, Luke 24:1, John 20:1).  The Friday before Jesus' resurrection was Nisan 14.

Sanhedrin 43a from the Babylonian Talmud says Jesus died the day before Passover:

>  Sanhedrin 43a from the Babylonian Talmud:  "On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning."[^babylonian-talmud:a]

### The Passover when Jesus died was Friday, the day before the Sabbath.

Mark 15:42 says when Joseph of Arimathea asked for the body of Jesus:

> it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath)

And Luke 23:54:

> It was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning.

Likewise John 19:31, directly after Jesus dies, says the next day was the Sabbath:  

> Then because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies should not stay on the crosses on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an especially important one), the Jewish leaders asked Pilate to have the victims’ legs broken and the bodies taken down.

This was likely "an especially important" Sabbath because the Feast of Unleavened Bread occurred on the same day.  Since it always occurs on the first day of Passover (Leviticus 23:5-7, Numbers 28:26).

Matthew 27:52, John 19:14, and 19:42 also say it was "the day of preparation" when Jesus was killed, a word which typically means the Friday before the Sabbath.[^josephus-93:e] [^hoehner-1978:k] Mark 15:42 and Luke 23:54 even explain that the day of preparation is before the Sabbath.

### Not Crucified on Wednesday or Thursday

Some propose that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday or Thursday, based on Matthew 12:40:

> For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.

Jesus rose on or just before the first day of the week (Matthew 28:1 Mark 16:2, 9, Luke 24:1, John 20:1, 19), Taking a literal interpretation either about 3 days, or exactly hours, they count backward from this time to arrive at Thursday or Wednesday.

#### Before/On/After the Third Day

Various New Testament passages at first seem to contradict as to whether Jesus would rise from the dead either before, on, or after the third day:

- **Before the third day**:  In Matthew 27:63-64 the soldiers were to guard the tomb "until the third day."  The key word being "until."  Likewise in Luke 24:21, "it is the third day" since Jesus was crucified.  This was still the first day of the week (Sunday) as 24:1 and 24:13 make clear.
- **On the third day:**  Jesus says he will rise "on the third day" in Matthew 16:21, 17:23, 20:19, Mark 9:31, Luke 9:22, 18:33, and 24:7.  Acts 10:40 and 1 Cor 15:4 also say Christ was raised on the third day.
- **After the third day:**  And only Matthew 12:40, Mark 8:31, 9:31, and 10:34 say Jesus rises after three days.

#### No such thing as a mid-week "Sabbath"

However, the Wednesday and Thursday crucifixion theories are incompatible with John 19:31 since the day following the crucifixion was a Sabbath.  Some propose that the Feast of Unleavened Bread could also be called a Sabbath on no matter what day of the week it occurred, since like the Sabbath, Jews were to do no work (Leviticus 23:5-7).  But there's no evidence the Feast of Unleavened Bread was ever called a Sabbath:

> The argument that since Nisan 15 is a holy convocation on which no one works and thus conclude that it was a Sabbath is a *non sequitur*.  There is no evidence for this anywhere.  This is a creation of those who hold this theory only to fit their [Wednesday or Thursday crucifixion] theory.[^hoehner-1978:i]  

Furthermore, John's use of "an especially important Sabbath" fits the Sabbath and Feast of Unleavened Bread being on the same day.

Some cite Matthew 28:1, literally "at the end of the Sabbaths" as evidence the week had more than one Sabbath.  But one third of all new Testament mentions of "Sabbath" is plural when speaking of only one day.[^hoehner-1978:j]

#### Sunday was "the third day"

One version of the Wednesday crucifixion theory attempt to reconcile the on/after verses by proposing that Jesus rose from the dead on Saturday at sunset, and thus rose at the boundary between "on" and "after" three days/nights.  

But this view is incompatible with where Luke 24:21 says "it is now the third day" since Jesus was crucified, which was also the first day of the week (Luke 24:1, 24:13).  It also couldn't have still been the Sabbath because Mary mistook Jesus for the gardener in John 20:15, who would not have been working on the Sabbath.

#### Jews Often Used Inclusive Counting

Early sources also indicate that Jews counted inclusively.

Rabbi Eliezar b. Azariah (Elazar b. Azaryah) stated around 110-135 AD:

> Rebbi Ismael treats part of a term like the whole, but Rebbi Aqiba does not treat part of a term like the whole. It was stated so about Rebbi Aqiba: “Therefore if part of the first term had elapsed, one completes it by the sixth term.” It was stated: Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah says, day and night each are a term, and part of a term is like the whole."[^jerusalem-talmud:a]

Rabbi Hiyya (or Chiyya) stated around 200-220AD:

> with regard to the halakhot [law] of mourning, the legal status of part of the day is like that of an entire day.[^babylonian-talmud:b]

Although sometimes the length of a day was disputed:

> At the outset what did he hold, and ultimately what did he hold? Initially, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi held that the legal status of part of the day is like that of an entire day, and since the thirtieth day already begun, Rabbi Hiyya’s time of admonition had ended. But ultimately he held that with regard to this issue we do not say that the legal status of part of the day is like that of an entire day.[^babylonian-talmud:c]

Likewise the Jewish Encyclopedia says:

> In Jewish communal life part of a day is at times reckoned as one day; e.g., the day of the funeral, even when the latter takes place late in the afternoon, is counted as the first of the seven days of mourning; a short time in the morning of the seventh day is counted as the seventh day;[^jewish-encyclopedia-day]

#### Examples of Inclusive Counting

Other passages in both the Old and New Testaments use before/on/after 3 days interchangeably:

- Genesis 42:17-19 tells of Joseph dealing with his brothers: "he put them all together in custody for three days... On the third day Joseph said to them... let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households"
- Esther 4:16, Esther asks Mordecai to have the Jews fast: “do not eat or drink for three days, night or day.  I and my young women will also fast as you do.  Then I will go to the king...” And then in 5:1, "On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace."
- 2 Chronicles 10:5, 12, "Come again unto me after three days. ... So ... all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day.”
- Luke 13:32-33, "He [Jesus] replied, 'Go tell that fox [Herod], "I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal." In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!'"

And in the writings of Josephus:

- David commanded Amassa "come to him within three days"  But Amasa "made some delay... and so was not yet returned."  Then "on the third day," David said "It is not fit we should make any delay."[^josephus-93:f]

#### No signs of Decay on the Shroud of Turin

The Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus.  It suggests Jesus was likely in the grave less than 40 hours, since it doesn't show chemical evidence of a decaying body, which occurs about 40 hours after death:[^lazzaro-2012]

> On the Shroud there are no signs of putrefactions, which occur at the orifices about 40 h after death. This means that the image does not depend on putrefaction gases and the corpse was wrapped in the Shroud not longer than two days.

This short time span is also the most compatible with a Friday crucifixion.

## April 3, 33 AD Crucifixion

==TODO Sir Anderson's incorrect calculation==

### A Friday Passover Eve only occurs in 30 and 33 AD.

In the years between 27 and 34AD, the 14th day of Nisan (Passover Eve) was on a Friday only in 30 and 33 AD.[^maier-1968:d] [^hoehner-1978:a]  New Testament professor Joachim Jeremias,[^jeremias-1977:a]  New Testament historian and archaeologist Jack Finegan,[^finegan-1989:a] as well as Colin J. Humphreys and Graeme Waddington[^humphreys-1985:a] have calculated what day of the week Passover was on during possible relevant years.  The table below combines their calculations:

{[class="small style1"]}

### Three years after ministry start is 32-33 AD.

Based above on Jesus starting his ministry about 29 AD and having about four Passovers, the crucifixion at the fourth Passover would be on April 3, 33 AD.  Even if we only use the three Passovers explicitly mentioned in John, this is still too much time for a 30 AD crucifixion.

### Lunar Eclipse on April 3, 33 AD

#### In Acts 2 / Joel 2:31

A partial lunar eclipse happened on April 3, 33 AD[^hind-1872:a] [^nasa-2006] (the day of the crucifixion) which could be seen in the Easter sky at sunset in Jerusalem.  Seven weeks afterward, Peter says the moon had changed "to blood" at the crucifixion:  Acts 2:16, 20, 22-23:

> **16** ...this is what was spoken about through the prophet Joel: ...
>
> **20** "The sun will be changed to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes." ...
>
> **22** Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man clearly attested to you by God with powerful deeds, wonders, and miraculous signs that God performed among you through him, just as you yourselves know— **23** this man, who was handed over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed by nailing him to a cross at the hands of Gentiles.

A "blood moon" was a common way to describe a lunar eclipse in the ancient world.[^humphreys-1985:b]  In Acts 2:20 Peter quotes Joel 2:31 from the Old Testament, written hundreds of years before the time of Christ.  Peter cites the darkness and the blood moon as if it were recently fulfilled by Christ.

#### Cyril of Alexandria and a Forged Report of Pilate

In addition to Acts 2, Cyril of Alexandria, in his fifth century commentary on Joel, says the moon looked like blood after the crucifixion, although the gospel writers didn't mention it:

> Perhaps something unusual also happened to the orb of the moon, causing it to appear to be changed into blood.... there was silence on the part of the holy evangelists about such an event,[^cyril-412]

The Report of Pilate is a forgery from the fifth centuries[^ baudoin-2017:a] with obvious historical errors showing it couldn't have been written by Pilate.[^baudoin-2017] It likewise says:[^report-of-pilate]

> At the time he was crucified there was darkness over all the world... and the moon, as if turned into blood, failed in her light.

These may be of little use since it's not known if these use Acts 2 as a source or if they use a separate tradition of a blood moon.

#### Table of Lunar Eclipses

<img src="chronology-of-christ-files/britannica-2014-lunar-eclipse.jpg?w=1000" class="lightbox inverted" style="width: 100%">

The diagram above[^britannica-lunar-eclipse] is not to scale.

The table below was put together using Stellarium's Astronomical Calculations tool to find all lunar eclipses visible from Jerusalem between 26 and 36 AD, where at least part of the moon was at least partially within the Earth's umbra while visible above the horizon.  Although even when the moon is outside the earth's umbra it will still be partially darkened within Earth's penumbra.

This unique lunar eclipse adds weight to the April 3, 33AD crucifixion date.

Physicists Sir Colin J. Humphreys and Graeme Waddington published[^humphreys-1985:c] a similar table in 1985, but are a little off on some of the dates, perhaps due to lacking modern computers.

There was also a total (100%) lunar eclipse on Monday, April 14, 32 AD,[^nasa-2006] which is also a possible Passover date, although Sunday, April 13th is a more likely Passover date for 32 AD.  But no part of the eclipse was visible from Jerusalem, moon had already gone below the horizon three hours before it first entered earth's penumbra at 8:31 am Jerusalem time.

#### Redness of a Low-Horizon, Partial Lunar Eclipse

We should expect the moon to appear very red during either a total (100%) lunar eclipse or during a partial lunar eclipse that happens near the horizon.[^humphreys-1985:d] On August 7, 2017 there was partial lunar eclipse with about the same amount of darkness coverage as the lunar eclipse of April 3, 33 AD.  Note how the moon appears red in Europe where it could be seen near the horizon (first two photos), but not in Asia where it would be higher in the sky (last three photos).

Matthew 27:50-54 and the Greek historian Phlegon[^eusebius-chronicon] of 137 AD mention an earthquake at the crucifixion, which may have also stirred up dust that also made the moon appear more red.  Some improperly cite Sibylline Oracles Book 3 (from the 6th or 7th century) to say the darkness at the crucifixion was due to a dust storm which would also increase the moon's redness, but the vague text makes no mention Christ's crucifixion.[^sibylline-oracles]

Most lunar eclipses occur while we're asleep, but on April 3, 33 AD, most people in Israel would've been watching the western sky for sunset to know when to begin Passover, and been very surprised to see a red moon rising in the east.[^humphreys-1985:e]  Seven weeks later at Pentecost in Acts 2, the crowd would've easily understood what blood moon Peter was referring to.

#### Bradley Schaefer's Argument

In 1990, NASA scientist Bradley Schaefer argued the moon would not be visible because the sky near the horizon at sunset would be too bright.[^schaefer-1990:a]  However, this is disproved clear photos of lunar eclipses near the horizon, such as the first photo above, and the the September 7, 2006 lunar eclipse, as seen from Ireland in the three photos below, which are actually under-exposed to make the moon appear *less* bright[^mckenna-2006] even though the moon was even more darkened than the lunar eclipse of 33 AD:

{[class="c3"]}

| -----------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

Additionally, Schaefer considered himself "not qualified" to calculate the altitude of the moon when the eclipse happened, and relied on others to calculate this, with varying results he assumed were due to "fundamental uncertainties which are not likely to be overcome in the near future."[^schaefer-1990:b]

#### Fulfilled Prophecy of Joel 2:31

Passover occurs at full moon and lunar eclipses, when they occur, happen at a full moon.  But in 33 AD it was somewhat difficult to accurately calculate which full moons would be a lunar eclipse.  Although it may have been possible with machines like the Antikythera Mechanism, which is likely from 205 to 65 BC.[^frost-2017:a]  It seems difficult to not just know when a blood moon will occur, but also to get yourself killed by the piercing of hands and feet (Psalm 22:16) to fulfill the blood moon prophecy of Joel 2:31.

==TODO==

Daniel could not have predicted a lunar eclipse in 33 AD.

> Cambridge History of Science Volume 1, pages

> The Babylonian astronomers combined knowledge of the Saros period with the fact that eclipse possibilities generally occur after six months but occasionally take place after a five-month interval to develop a method for predicting all lunar and solar eclipse possibilities for many centuries.

But Jesus could've known that there was an upcoming lunar eclipse.

> In Babylon, by at least the middle of the seventh century BC, and probably as early as the middle of the eighth century BC, astronomical observations were being systematically conducted and recorded in a group of texts which we have come to call Astronomical Diaries. These Diaries contain many observations and predictions of eclipses. The predictions generally include the expected time of the eclipse, apparently calculated quite precisely.  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AHES...54..421S/abstract



> At, at least for lunar eclipses, they were even able to predict the watch during which it would occur. The approximate time of the expected eclipse was apparently determined by observing whether the moon and sun were visible together on the previous few days.
>
> Indeed, between -746 [BC] and -340 [BC] the scheme correctly predicts every eclipse that was visible in Babylon. On -339 [BC] September 29 and again on -321 [BC] October 20 a lunar eclipse occurred which was not predicted by this scheme. Instead, eclipses were predicted one month earlie
>
> When the Babylonian astronomers were predicting the time of the beginning of the eclipse, they generally obtained times that were accurate to between 1 and 2 hours for the eclipses we could expect them to have then been able to observe.  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AHES...54..421S/abstract

### Pilate became soft on Jews after the death of Sejanus in 31 AD

https://twitter.com/UpdatingOnRome/status/1701670265246142470

In 26 or 27 AD, Roman Emperor Tiberius retired to the island of Capri, leaving Sejanus in control of the empire.  Sejanus was very anti-Jewish.  He may have been the one who appointed Pilate as governor of Judea in 26 AD.[^maier-1968:c] [^hoehner-1978:h] And Pilate was also very anti-Jewish

1. Pilate brought in Roman Medallions shortly after his arrival in Judea.
2. Pilate built an aqueduct with money he took from the Temple treasury.  This led to a Jewish riot where Pilate put disguised soldiers into the crowd who upon receiving a signal, clubbed the rioters.
3. Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.  Luke 13:1
4. In 30-31 AD Pilate minted coins with the pagan Roman auguer, which would've been offensive to the Jews.

However, Tiberius had Sejanus executed in 31 AD and then began prosecuting other appointees of Sejanus as traitors.  Around 31 AD, Tiberius wrote a threatening letter to Pilate in response to a complaint from the Jews about golden shields being setup in Herod's Palace.[^philo-40:b]

Jesus claimed to be king and the Jews wanted Pilate to execute him, threatening "If you release this man you are no friend of Caesar."  Making the Jews upset would've carried little weight in 30 AD when Pilate was reporting to the anti-Jewish Sejanus.  But in 33 AD it was masterfully crafted political intimidation.

==TODO: Go through Maier and Hoehner to cite these things from Philo, Josephus, Seutonius, etc.==

### Earthquake in 31 AD, plus or minus 5 years

Matthew 27:50-54 mentions an earthquake at the crucifixion, and 28:2 an earthquake at the resurrection, as does the Greek historian Phlegon[^eusebius-chronicon] in 137 AD.

Jefferson Williams and two other geologists counted varves (annual layers) in the dead sea, starting at a large and well documented Earthquake of 31BC And counting upward.  They estimated there was another Earthquake around 31 AD, plus or minus 5 years because some varves were hard to distinguish.[^williams-2011:a]  However, this doesn't give us enough accuracy to tell which year was the crucifixion.

### The Talmud on Bad Omens

The temple was destroyed in August of 70 AD.

Yoma 39b:5-6:

> The Sages taught: During the tenure of Shimon HaTzaddik, the lot for God always arose in the High Priest’s right hand; after his death, it occurred only occasionally; but during the forty years prior to the destruction of the Second Temple, the lot for God did not arise in the High Priest’s right hand at all. So too, the strip of crimson wool that was tied to the head of the goat that was sent to Azazel did not turn white, and the westernmost lamp of the candelabrum did not burn continually.  
>
> And the doors of the Sanctuary opened by themselves as a sign that they would soon be opened by enemies, until Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai scolded them. He said to the Sanctuary: Sanctuary, Sanctuary, why do you frighten yourself with these signs? I know about you that you will ultimately be destroyed, and Zechariah, son of Ido, has already prophesied concerning you: “Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars” (Zechariah 11:1), Lebanon being an appellation for the Temple.[^baylonian-talmud:e]

Rosh Hashanah 31b:17

> And it is taught in a baraita: During the forty years before the Second Temple was destroyed the strip of crimson wool would not turn white; rather, it would turn a deeper shade of red.[^babylonian-talmud:d]

### The Talmud on Jewish Capital Punishment

The Talmud says the Jews were no longer allowed to impose the death penalty after about 30 AD.  Shabbat 15a:9:

> Forty years before the Temple was destroyed, the Sanhedrin was exiled from the Chamber of Hewn Stones... Rather, emend and say: That they no longer judged capital cases. The authority to impose the death penalty was stripped from the Sanhedrin, and therefore they willingly left the Chamber of Hewn Stone.[^babylonian-talmud:g]

Avodah Zarah 8b:11:

> Forty years before the Temple was destroyed, the Sanhedrin was exiled from the Chamber of Hewn Stone and sat in the store near the Temple Mount.[^babylonian-talmud:f]

In John 8:1-8, the Pharisees try to trap Jesus in having him say that the woman caught in adultery should be executed.  John 8:6, "now they were asking this in an attempt to trap him, so that they could bring charges against him," which implies this took place after they were forbidden to execute.

### Early Writers

==TODO Finegan may list a lot of these?==

==TODO: Move all the early writers' chronologies to a separate file?==

==TODO from here:  "Ancient Estimates of Hippolytus (18th year of Tiberius), Maximus the Confessor (21) , Cassiodorus (31), Lactantius (29)==

#### Tertullian:  29 AD

Tertullian says Jesus died in the 15th year of Tiberius, which would be on March 25, 29 AD.[^mosshammer-2008:a]  Although the table above shows Passover in 29 AD was on April 18th or possibly April 17th.

>For, after Augustus who survived after the birth of Christ, are made up 15 years. He was succeeded by Tiberius Caesar, who held the empire 20 years, 7 months, and 28 days. (In the 15th year of his reign Christ suffered, being about 30 years of age when he suffered.)[^tertullian-200:a]

#### Eusebius:  32 AD

Around perhaps the year 313 AD, Christian historian Eusebius estimated that Jesus' ministry lasted 3-4 years.

> Jesus Christ, according to the prophecies, which had been spoken about him beforehand, came to the Passion in the 18th year of Tiberius, at which time also we find these things written verbatim in other commentaries of the gentiles: an eclipse of the sun happened 1, Bithynia shaken by earthquake, and in the city of Nicaea many buildings collapsed: all of which agree with what occurred in the Passion of the Saviour.[^eusebius-chronicon]

#### Phlegon:  33 AD

Directly after the quote above, Eusebius quotes the Greek historian Phlegon, who wrote around 137 AD.

> Phlegon, who is an excellent calculator of olympiads, also writes about this, in his 13th book writing thus:
>
> > However in the fourth year of the 202^nd^ olympiad, an eclipse of the sun happened, greater and more excellent than any that had happened before it; at the sixth hour, day turned into dark night, so that the stars were seen in the sky, and an earthquake in Bithynia toppled many buildings of the city of Nicaea.[^eusebius-chronicon]

The Olympiads started in 776 BC and began each July/August.  The 202nd Olympiad therefore began on -776 + 201*4 + 1 = 29 AD.  The fourth year of this Olympiad was thefore from about July/August 32 Ad to July/August 33 AD.  The only Passover during this time would have been April 3, 33 AD.

#### Clement of Alexandria:  28 AD

> And from the time that He suffered till the destruction of Jerusalem are forty-two years and three months. https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02101.htm

#### Hippolytus:  32-33 AD

Hippolytus of Rome in his commentary on Daniel, written around 202 AD, says Jesus was killed in the 18th year of Tiberius, which would be 32-33 AD.

> For the first advent of our Lord in the flesh, when he was born in Bethlehem, was December 25th, Wednesday, while Augustus was in his forty-second year, but from Adam, five thousand and five hundred years. He suffered in the thirty-third year, March 25th, Friday, the eighteenth year of Tiberius Caesar, while Rufus and Roubellion were Consuls.

[^biblegateway:a]: See the NET translator's note "b" on [John 2:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+2%3A20&version=NET):  "A close parallel to the aorist οἰκοδομήθη (*oikodomēthē*) can be found in Ezra 5:16 (LXX), where it is clear from the following verb that the construction had not yet been completed. Thus the phrase has been translated “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years.” Some, however, see the term ναός (*naos*) here as referring only to the sanctuary and the aorist verb as consummative, so that the meaning would be “this temple was built forty-six years ago” (so *ExSyn* 560-61). Ultimately in context the logic of the authorities’ reply appears to fit more naturally if it compares length of time for original construction with length of time to reconstruct it."

[^cyrus-412:a]: "In response to the impious behavior of the Jews—I mean that committed against Christ—even the very nature of the elements was upset, and creation, as it were, grieved to see its Lord insulted. The divine Temple was, so to speak, distressed equally with the mourners and suffered rupture; Scripture says, “The veil of the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The sun reduced its brightness and suppressed its rays, and did not deign to shine any longer on the inhabitants of the earth. This resulted, in fact, in darkness from the sixth hour to the ninth hour; the rocks were split; perhaps something unusual also happened to the orb of the moon, causing it to appear to be changed into blood. While there was silence on the part of the holy evangelists about such an event, worthy of belief because it was on the basis of the prophecy, the fact that it was by the will of the Creator that not only did the signs happen in the sun, but, as it were, the whole of creation took on an ugly appearance unusual for it, would be clear from God’s statement in Isaiah, “I shall clothe heaven with darkness, and make sackcloth its covering."

One of the most exciting historical examples is the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient machine that kept track of the date, and the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets. “It also predicted eclipses and kept track of upcoming Olympic games,” Jones writes in his book A Portable Cosmos: Revealing the Antikythera Mechanism.<br>...<br>Found in 1901 on a wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, it is believed to date to some time between 205 and 87 B.C., though the wreck itself probably happened around 65 B.C."

[^hoehner-1978:a]: Page 82:  "There have been several studies in this, and their conclusions are that the only possible times Nisan 14 fell on a Friday were in the years of A.D. 27, 30, 33, and 36.  Of these, A.D. 27 is the least likely astronomically.  In that year it is possible that Nisan 14 fell on a Thursday rather than a Friday.  The year of A.D. 30 has also been debated, but it is reasonably certain that Nisan 14 was a Friday that year."
[^hoehner-1978:b]: Page 29:  "the rebuilding of the temple, which according to Josephus' *Antiquitates Judaicae (XV. 11. 1 380) began in the eighteenth year of Herod's reign, coincides with the arrival of Augustus in Syria, which according to Dio Cassius occurred in the spring or summer of 20 B.C. This is corroborated in Josephus' other account, where he states that this Augustan visit to Syria was ten years after his first visit in 30 B.C. Therefore, since the eighteenth year of Herod's reign was from Nisan 1, 20 B.C. to Nisan 1, 19 B.C.,4Z Josephus must have reckoned from 37 B.C. and not 40 B.C."
[^hoehner-1978:c]: Page 29:  "Returning to Josephus it seems clear that the first part of Herod's rebuilding the temple was the temple edifice which was done by the priests in one year and six months."
[^hoehner-1978:d]: Page 24:  "The fifth opinion is that Luke used the normal Roman method of reckoning, according to which Tiberius' fifteenth year would have run from August 19, 28 to August 18, 29. Lewin states: "The reign of Tiberius, as beginning from 19th Aug. A.D. 14, was as well-known a date in the time of Luke as the reign of Queen Victoria in our own day, and that no single case has ever been or can be produced in which the years of Tiberius were reckoned in any other way." The biggest objection to this view is that it would be too complicated and confusing to reckon according to dynastic years. However, on the other hand, since Luke was addressing a Roman official it is plausible to think that he would have been familiar with dynastic years."
[^hoehner-1978:e]: Some say the beginning of Tiberius's reign should count as starting in not 14 AD when he became emperor, but in 11 AD when he became coregent with Augustus.  But nobody counts it this way.  Hoehner notes on page 22:  "this method is to be rejected because there is no evidence, either from historical documents or coins, for its employment whereas there is abundant evidence that Tiberius reckoned his first year after the death of Augustus."  And on page 85:  "There is no evidence, either from historical documents or coins, that Tiberius' reign was ever reckoned from his coregency."

[^humphreys-1985:d]: "There is great variability in exact colouration from eclipse to eclipse owing to atmospheric conditions. As explained previously, the umbral shadow is normally blood red. However, this colour is most noticeable during total lunar eclipses. For partial eclipses, particularly with the moon at high altitude, there is a large contrast difference between the obscured and unobscured part of the moon, so that the moon often appears almost white with a very dark 'bite' removed. However for some partial eclipses the red colour of the umbral. shadow is clearly visible. For example, Davis has recently depicted in colour an eclipse sequence as seen by the human eye with the moon low in the sky, and the colouration of the umbra in the partial eclipse phase is almost as vivid as when the eclipse is total.  For the case of the eclipse of 3 April A.D. 33 the moon was just above the horizon. The most probable colour of the rising moon would be red in the umbra] shadow (shaded in Fig. 1) and yellow-orange elsewhere.  At moonrise the initially small yellow-orange region would indicate that the moon had risen, but with most of its visible area 'turned to blood."
[^humphreys-1985:e]: "The majority of lunar eclipses pass unnoticed, occurring when we are asleep or indoors. This eclipse however would probably have been seen by most of the population of Israel, since the Jews on Passover Day would be looking for both sunset and moonrise in order to commence their Passover meal.  Instead of seeing the expected full Paschal moon rising they would have initially seen a moon with a red 'bite' removed (Fig. 1). The effect would be dramatic. The moon would grow to full in the next half-hour. The crowd on the day of Pentecost would undoubtably understand Peter's words, the moon turning to blood, as referring to this eclipse which they had seen."

[^humphreys-2011:a]: [Page 64](chronology-of-christ-files/humphreys-2011-pages64-65.png):  "Luke tells us that he wrote his gospel for a person called Theophilus (Luke 14), and from the way that Luke addresses him he was probably a Roman official.3 The style in which Luke writes, 'In the fifteenth year of the reign of', is typical Of the style Of Roman and Greek historians of the time. So how did Roman historians of the time count the years of Tiberius? As we saw in Chapter 2, John Meier states:  'All the major Roman historians who calculate the years of Tiberius' rule — namely, Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio — count from AD 14, the year of Augustus' death.'<br><br>Nearly all modern scholars agree that the 'fifteen years' of Luke 3:1—2 should be counted from AD 14. However, a few scholars, for example Rainer Riesner, argue that the fifteen years should be counted from Tiberius' joint rule with Augustus. There is no evidence to support this and Meier somewhat scathingly states: 'Presumably, Luke, who is intent on trying to follow the conventions of Greco-Roman historiography, would not have chosen an unheard-of means of reckoning Tiberius' years over a generally accepted one.' In addition, it is clear from the coin evidence that Tiberius started to reign in AD 14 (see Chapter 1, fig. 2.1).<br><br>It is therefore clear that the fifteenth year of the reign Of Tiberius should be counted from his appointment as the new emperor by the Roman Senate on September 17, AD 14. If we were counting the years of his reign today we would say that the first year was September 17, AD 14 to September 17, AD 15, so that the fifteenth year of his reign was from September 17, AD 28 to September 17, AD 29. However, once again we must remind ourselves that the way we count today is not necessarily the same as the way people counted in the first century AD.<br><br>Since Luke was writing to the Roman Theophilus, and since Luke is written about the Roman emperor Tiberius, using a Roman style of writing, Luke is probably using the standard Roman method of counting regnal years when he refers to the fifteenth year of Tiberius. It is known that Roman historians of the time, such as Tacitus, dated the first year of a ruler's reign from January of the year following the ruler's appointment: So Roman historians counted the first year of the reign of Tiberius as January I to December 31, AD (and the last year of the reign of the previous emperor, Augustus, as January I to l)ecember 31, AD 14), since the Roman year, using the Julian calendar, started on January 1. Thus Luke probably meant by the 'fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius' the period January I to December 31, AD 29.<br><br>However, we cannot be certain that Luke used the standard Roman method of counting the years of rulers, and he may have used a Jewish calendar. If he was using the Jewish religious calendar that began in the spring, then, as Finegan shows, the fifteenth year of Tiberius was spring AD 29 to spring An 30. If he was using the Jewish civil calendar that began in the previous autumn then the fifteenth year was autumn AD 28 to autumn AD 29."

And as he promised them this beforehand, so he did not break his word with them: but got ready a thousand waggons, that were to bring stones for the building; and chose out ten thousand of the most skilful workmen, and bought a thousand sacerdotal garments, for as many of the priests; and had some of them taught the arts of stone cutters, and others of carpenters; and then began to build: but this not till every thing was well prepared for the work."

(14 A.D.), hence 781-82 A.U.C (29-29 A.D.), a dating system regularly used by Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio Cassius.  The actual fifteenth regnal year of Tiberius would run from August 19, 28 A.D., to August 18, 29 A.D., so the beginning of John's ministry should have fallen within these dates.  Since Roman historians of the time usually dated the first regnal year of a princepts from January 1 of the year following the date of accession, the year 29 would seem intended here."<br><br>[Page 6](chronology-of-christ-files/maier-1968-page-6.png):  "The normal Roman understanding of the fifteenth year as dating from the accession of Tiberius, then, would seem the most natural also in this instance.  Not only is this the method of our chief Roman sources for the early principate--Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio--but a system confirmed by the epigraphy, coinage, and papyri from the Mediterranean world during this era.  It seems improbable, more over, that an event anchored to the regnal years of a Roman emperor would use a system of reckoning those years different from that employed by the princeps and S.P.Q.R. themselves, as well as the Empire in general.  It seems further unlikely that the author of Luke-Acts would have dared 'ignore' the last two years of the great Augustus and added them to the reign of his successor in this careful calculation of the date of John's opening ministry.  And since Luke-Acts is addressed to a 'most excellent' Theophilus, a form of address used elsewhere by the same author only for a Roman official (Acts 23:26, 24:2), the Gospel was likely written for a gentile and Roman consumption and thus involved normal Roman chronology.  In interpreting `the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,' then, reckoning should proceed not from a co-regency in 12 A.D., but from the death of Augustus and accession of Tiberius in 14--hence 28-29 AD."

Accordingly, Finegan quite properly concludes, with Fotheringham et al., "... the two dates which are possible, astronomically and calendrically, for the crucifixion are:  Friday Apr 7, A.D. 30 and Friday Apr 3, A.D. 33."

[^mishna:a]: Ta'anit 1:4-7, "If the seventeenth of Marḥeshvan arrived and rain has not fallen, individuals, but not the entire community, begin to fast three fasts for rain.... If these fasts have passed and they have not been answered the court does not decree additional fasts, but the entire community observes the customs of mourning. They decrease their engagement in business transactions, in building and planting... if Nisan has ended and rains subsequently fall, they are a sign of a curse, as it is stated: “Is not the wheat harvest today?"

[^mosshammer-2008:a]: Page 336:  "Tertullian said (Adversus Iudaeos 8. 16) that Jesus was crucified at the age of 30 on 25 March in the 15th year of Tiberius, the consulship of Rubellius Geminus and Fufius Geminus, AD 29. That date became the traditional date of the Passion in the Roman church. In Tertullian's formulation, the date entails a very short chronology for the ministry of Jesus, perhaps too short."

[^philo-40:a]: "Pilate was one of the emperor's lieutenants, having been appointed governor of Judaea. He, not more with the object of doing honour to Tiberius than with that of vexing the multitude, dedicated some gilt shields in the palace of Herod, in the holy city; which had no form nor any other forbidden thing represented on them except some necessary inscription, which mentioned these two facts, the name of the person who had placed them there, and the person in whose honour they were so placed there. (300) But when the multitude heard what had been done, and when the circumstance became notorious, then the people, putting forward the four sons of the king, who were in no respect inferior to the kings themselves, in fortune or in rank, and his other descendants, and those magistrates who were among them at the time, entreated him to alter and to rectify the innovation which he had committed in respect of the shields; and not to make any alteration in their national customs, which had hitherto been preserved without any interruption, without being in the least degree changed by any king of emperor."
[^philo-40:b]: "And those who were in power in our nation, seeing this, and perceiving that he was inclined to change his mind as to what he had done, but that he was not willing to be thought to do so, wrote a most supplicatory letter to Tiberius. (304) And he, when he had read it, what did he say of Pilate, and **what threats did he utter against him!** But it is beside our purpose at present to relate to you how very angry he was, although he was not very liable to sudden anger; since the facts speak for themselves; for immediately, without putting any thing off till the next day, he wrote a letter, **reproaching and reviling him in the most bitter manner** for his act of unprecedented audacity and wickedness, and commanding him immediately to take down the shields and to convey them away from the metropolis of Judaea to Caesarea, on the sea which had been named Caesarea Augusta, after his grandfather, in order that they might be set up in the temple of Augustus. And accordingly, they were set up in that edifice."

[^schaefer-1990:a]:  "Page 62: middle "The sun is always close to the horizon whenever an eclipsed moon is rising, so daylight or twilight may strongly interfere with the visibility of the moon."
[^schaefer-1990:b]:  Page 59, bottom:  "For calculations concerning the visibility of the eclipse from Jerusalem, the vital parameter is the apparent altitude of the moon when the end of the (umbral) eclipse happened.  The calculation of ancient eclipse circumstances is a complicated problem, one which I am not qualified to answer.  To overcome this problem, I have consulted Fred Espenak (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center), John Bangert (U.S. Naval OBservatory(, Jean Meeus and Hermann Mucke (Meeus & Muck 1979) and Graem Waddington (Humphreys & Waddington 1983) and Waddington 1988, private communication)... In this tabulation, the results of Humphreys and Waddington stand out from the other five calculations concerning the eclipse magnitude and duration.  The reason for this difference is not clear, since these two parameters have only slight dependences on the assumed delta-T and lunar acceleration.  The primary result of these calculations is that the altitude of the moon at the time of the umbral contact is between 2.0 and 5.65 degrees.  I believe that these differences are indicative of fundamental uncertainties which are not likely to be overcome in the near future.  While it may be that the actual altitude is outside this range, I will follow the best modern calculations which indicate that at umbral contact the moon had an altitude of 3.8 degrees altitude (with a possible error of 1.9 degrees)."

[^williams-2011:a]: We have tabulated a varved chronology from a corefrom Ein Gedi on the western shore of the Dead Sea between deformed sediments due to a widespread earthquake in 31 BCand deformed sediments due to an early ﬁrst-century earthquake. The early ﬁrst-century seismic event has been tentativelyassigned a date of 31 AD with an accuracy of ±5 years.<br>...<br>While a previous study (Migowski et al. 2004)attempted to reconcile a varve-counted seismite date observed in the section to an earthquake date(33 AD) listed in the earthquake catalogues (e.g. Willis 1928; Amiran *et al.* 1994), this study makes no assumptions about the likely date of this early ﬁrst-century seismite.  A date was assigned to the seismite based on varve counting alone.<br>...<br>*Similar layers are found elsewhere in the world* .As noted by Ken-Tor *et al.* (2001a), similar soft sediment deformation structures have been documented in several other localities worldwide and interpreted as seismites.<br>...<br>Correlation to docum\*ented earthquakes. In the 1522-year varve-counting interval in the Ein Gedicore, brecciated layers were correlated to 28 historically documented earthquakes (Migowsk *et al.* 2004). Seismites from other outcrops on the shores of the western Dead Sea have also been correlated to historically documented earthquakes.<br>...<br>Because of the ubiquity of sediment deformation due tothe 31 BC earthquake throughout the Dead Sea (Rechesand Hoexter 1981; Enzel *et al.* 2000; Ken-Tor *et al.* 2001a; Migowski *et al.* 2004; Kagan *et al.*  2011), once this event is identiﬁed in a given section, it can be treated as a chrono-logical anchor (see Event B in Figure 2). Varve counting,for example, can proceed from the 31 BC event upward inthe section towards more recent earthquake events. The primary historical source for the earthquake of the early spring of 31 BC is Josephus Flavius, who wrote in *The Jewish War* (Book 1, Chapter XIX, 370):<br>...<br>'But as he [King Herod] was avenging himself on his enemies, there fell upon him another providential calamity; for in the seventh year of his reign, when the war about Actium was at the height, at the beginning of the spring the earth was shaken, and destroyed an immense number of cattle, with thirty thousand men; but the army received no harm, because it lay in the open air.'<br>...<br>In the 62 years counted from 31 BC to 31 AD, 36 (58%)had a varve quality rating of 1 and 26 (42%) had a varve quality rating of 2 or higher. In addition to the varve quality tracks, two more track types are present. They are the facies tracks and years tracks<br>...<br>One way to determine the accuracy of this estimate is to compare the varve-counting accuracy of this study with that of Migowski (2001), who counted varves in the same core. Since both investigations independently came up with similar dates for the early ﬁrst-century earth-quake (31 AD vs. ∼33 AD in Migowski (2001)), this is considered to be a valid comparison. Between two well-deﬁned ‘anchor’ earthquakes of 31 BC and 1293 AD, Migowski (2001) counted 1324 varves. Of these, 94 yearswere masked by earthquake deformation. Inasmuch as Migowski (2001) used varve counts in the masked intervals to match her varve-counted year to historically documented earthquakes, the number of masked years in the 1324-year interval represents a combination of deformed layers and adjustments in the varve count to account for errors in varve counting; 94 years out of 1324 years amounts to 7.1%. Assuming a worst case scenario that the entire masked varve count is due to varve-counting errors, 7.1%of the 62-year interval between 31 BC and 31 AD amounts to 4.4 years. Rounding up, this means that for any given earthquake between 31 BC and 31 AD, the dating possesses an accuracy of at least ±5 years."
