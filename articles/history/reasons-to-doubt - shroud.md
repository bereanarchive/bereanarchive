## Reasons to Doubt - Shroud of Turin is Fake.  Part 1

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4yHs6IjBFQ

Hey guys.  I believe the shroud is authentic and I promote the evidence of a medieval repair.   I found these issues in your presentation.  Some are minor quibbles, others major, and some important omissions:

10:30 - You said STURP "published a paper and everything."  STURP published around two dozen papers in journals, not just a single one.

26:50 - You said that Benford+Marino looked at jpegs and identified a patch themselves.  But they sent photos of that corner to three textile experts, not telling them what it was a photo of, and all three out of three noted "there is something different left versus right" with one even saying it was "definitely a patch."  See Marino & Benford 2000.

27:50, 29:50 - You said STURP was on site and chose the samples and did the C14 dating, but Harry Gove's team went to a great deal of effort to exclude the involvement of anyone from STURP.  From page 193 of Harry Gove's 1996 book,  "What is in our power, however, is to ensure that STURP plays no role in carbon dating."  I see you've already acknowledged this in a comment.

38:40 - You said the Arizona sample had a "clean chain of custody."  I disagree.  Directly after the 1988 carbon dating, Michael Tite inexplicably took the freshly cut C14 samples to another room for 30 minutes only to return with them in opaque containers.  Tite had previously acquired a 3-in-1 linen weave from the early 14th century cope of St Louis d'Anjou.  See Gove 1990, or the interview with Tite in BSTS 25.

38:00 - A quibble.  There's a lot made of Ray Rogers publishing in journal where he used to be an editor, but no mention of Jull publishing in Radiocarbon where he was currently the chief editor.  Or that Jull runs the AMS lab at Arizona and was involved in the original C14 dating and would have egg on his face if it was shown to be incorrect.

41:28 - You said, "before the radiocarbon dating literally nobody said anything about a patch, including textile experts who had examined the Shroud in person for decades.  Absolutely nobody thought that this area was subject to a patch.  It only showed up as an explanation once carbon 14 dating gave something that was inconvenient."

This is a big one, as two archaeologists and a textile expert each independently warned the bottom left corner did not look original, PRIOR to the 1988 carbon dating:

Textile expert John Tyrer in Textile Horizons, 1981:  "There is therefore some doubt as to whether the sample described by Professor Raes as ‘Piece II’ is the edging strip or part of a patch. It is important that this matter be resolved if it is intended that the forthcoming carbon dating tests are to be made on Raes' sample. The patch is probably mediaeval."

Archaeologist William Meacham in 1986:  "Finally, the original sample was taken [by Gilbert Raes in 1973] at the junction of the side strip (believed by some scholars to be a later addition) and the (selvage?) border (possibly treated to prevent unraveling, and certainly more subject to contamination than the main body of the cloth). It could not be considered as a typical or representative sample of the relic."

Archaeologist Paul Maloney wrote in 2014:  "I was in attendance at the New London, Connecticut conference held on Oct. 10-11 of 1981. I distinctly remember a remark made by Joan Janney (now Mrs. Ray Rogers) that STURP found cotton spun into the linen threads in the Raes Corner/radiocarbon sample area of the Shroud.  I recently consulted with Barrie Schwortz about this and he confirmed that STURP was finding a lot of cotton inside the linen yarns there as opposed to the main body of the Shroud were none was found.  But this discovery was poorly understood then and so it was thought that the 'Raes Corner' area would not make a good candidate for radiocarbon test samples which was then being designed by a committee headed up by the late Robert Dinegar.  It clearly raised the question over whether any sample from that corner would be considered homogeneous and therefore suitable for testing... On March 22, 1988, nearly a month before the April 21 sample removal session, I sent a copy of this paper to Pope John Paul II... a minimum of three samples must be taken from three different areas on the Shroud."

42:12 - You ask, why would the nuns use crude patches in important areas, but "the da Vinci of patching" on a corner that doesn't matter?

This has been answered by King Umberto II, whose family, the Savoys, were the owners of the shroud in the middle ages.  He says his family was embarrassed at the poor state of the tattered corners and "those areas were repaired and rewoven using identical techniques, but obviously with similar, yet newer, materials containing dyes and other medieval manufacturing ingredients, in an attempt to better blend the new sections in, as best possible, with the original fabric."

45:45 - You say that Rogers said the fire had "no impact to the vanillin.  And to support that claim he gives absolutely nothing.  No data, no experiment, no paper, no nothing.  He just says it."

In a Dialogue between Ray Rogers and Bryan Walsh in Feb 2005, Rogers provides these calculations.  This is published in "What Went Wrong With the Shroud’s Radiocarbon Date? Setting it all in Context."  by Paul Maloney in 2014, in an appendix on pages 35 to 39.

Per those calculations, the shroud would need to be in the fire for 4 hours at 150C (423K) to have 95% vanillin loss. But the shroud body still has pentose impurities, which would degrade after 4 hours at only 100C (373K). Since the shroud still has pentose and blood spots, the 1532 AD fire therefore could not have significantly affected the vanillin content of the shroud.  Blood spots away from the scorch marks also should've degraded under heat.

Even ignoring these calculations, the presence of vanillin in the carbon dated corner but not the main body of the shroud is still evidence the two regions have a different source and/or a different history.

51:30 - You said "one new method on one hand that's not been tested on one hand and then we've got radiocarbon dating which has been used by decades by labs all across the world."

A quibble, but Rogers also did vanillin dating and Giulio Fanti did dating by comparing the mechanical strength of linen fibers of various ages, as well as a FT-IR analysis of fibers of various ages.  But like the X-ray crystallography these are new and untested--you're right to say that.

52:58 - You said De Caro et al "tested one fiber."  A quibble, but they tested one thread, which consists of dozens of fibers.

### OMISSIONS

In addition to some things in my comments above, there's a lot of other important evidence that's left out.

1. The carbon dated corner has cotton woven into it while the main body of the shroud is pure linen.  Among those who have personally examined material from the shroud, cotton in the bottom left corner has been noted by Gilbert Raes, managing director Peter South of the Oxford lab that dated the shroud, Ray Rogers, John Brown, Robert Villarreal, Barrie Schwortz, Sue Benford, Thibault Heimberger, Giulio Fanti, and even Freer Waters and Jull.  Rogers + Villareal even even found two cotton threads that were end-to-end spliced.
2. In addition to Rogers, a dye/coating on threads and fibers from that corner have been noted by chemist Alan Adler, chemist Robert Villareal, microscopist John L. Brown, and Pam Moon.  They've produced many excellent photos that clearly show this coating, including photos of it coming loose and dissolving in water, and some great electron microscope images showing the encrustations.  One excellent photo shows a yellow thread with white spots where it lacks dye where passed below a weft thread.
3. The radiocarbon corner appears visibly different in both visible and spectrographic images.

Apologies for the long comment.  You can find sources for all of this in an article I've published on my website.  Search for "Shroud of Turin Carbon Dating Berean Archive" and it should come up.  Cheers.



### Other notes not included

30:35 - "even if it was a patch, it could've been patched 10 years after the original."  Not quite an error per se, but just a difficult hypothesis.  If it was patched shortly after use as a burial shroud, why is it made of cotton dyed yellow to look older?

33:40 - Rogers found gum arabic.

34:35 - Garlaschelli and Bella on C14.  "laboriously cleaned"

35:45 - Rogers different samples were cleaned in different ways, maybe this causes a difference in Rogers' mass spectrometry results.

37:00 - Bella says a hydrocarbon could create the same spectrum as gum arabic.

38:00 - Freer Waters and Jull.  

39:00 - Freer Waters & Jull saw no evidence of dye under UV fluorescence or a microscope.

52:30 - Paper published in PLOS One was retracted.  

38:10 - You said Freer-Waters in an expert in tapestries "which is an expert in this specific thing."    I'm not a textile expert but I believe that tapestries are a very thick weave while the shroud is uses very fine threads.  In the British Society for the Turin Shroud newsletter 65, textile expert Mechthild Flury-Lemberg argued that an invisible repair could only be done the thick threads of a tapestry, not the fine linen of the shroud.  Note that textile experts Michael Ehrlich and Rubert Buden note that this type of invisible reweaving was done in the 16th century, and the latter notes having seen it in other samples.

There's a pinned comment on this video that includes the corrections we've found so far. Some of these are in there (STURP and De Caro's fiber counts). Regarding the others - "They published a paper and everything" was not intended to be a quantitative description of the number of papers they published. It was an offhand quip to keep things light. We're aware they published bunches of papers. - Arizona chain of custody: To be clear, the accusation being made here is that the sample used by Jull in publishing their paper was swapped with 14th century post-radiocarbon dating? - It seems that Tyrer & Meacham are both talking about the Raes sample specifically (which is near to but not the same as the place the radiocarbon dating was performed). They also don't seem to be talking about the same "invisible reweave" hypothesis that is the usual explanation given for the dating. Am I missing something? - Savoy's and their reweave technology: It seems to stretch credulity that their dyes would not be seen in any microscopic analysis and fail to show up on any spectroscopic analysis. Also that they would yellow and age at precisely the same rate as the undyed original linen. - Vanillin calculations: So Rogers provided the calculations for a paper he wrote in a private dialogue with Bryan Walsh, which was then published in a book a decade later? That seems to kind of undermine the point of publishing in a peer reviewed journal! More to the point, I think Bella's objection regarding the different treatments of Roger's sample vs the rest of the Shroud would need to be addressed before we put too much stock in the vanillin and other chemical differences. Regarding omissions, it is not possible for us to put every possible piece of information into an hour long video, or indeed even three hour long videos. If we cover one thing, we'll inevitably not cover something else that someone will say is a damning omission and clear evidence of our mustache twirling malevolence. That's just the nature of the beast.

## My Response

MICHAEL TITE CHAIN OF CUSTODY

I don't think there's enough evidence to say that Michael Tite swapped the samples.  Only that this was a rather suspicious violation of what you called a "clean chain of custody."

TYRER, MEACHAM, AND MALONEY

Textile expert John Tyrer said the Raes sample might be "part of a patch" (keyword part) which indicates an area larger than the Raes sample.  He says it "appears in photographs as different in tone and hue to the main area."  Photos of the shroud (in my article) show that this discoloration encompasses the whole radiocarbon area.

Archaeologist William Meacham said that the Raes sample was between the side strip and a possible selvage border, and this border area adjacent to the Raes sample was "possibly treated to prevent unraveling, and certainly more subject to contamination than the main body of the cloth."  So he was also concerned about more than just the Raes sample.

Archaeologist Paul Maloney was very clearly talking about the whole corner, since Gilbert Raes's sample had already been removed five years before STURP was finding cotton in that corner in 1978.

Bella 2015 claims nobody prior to the C14 dating saw any issues.  Garlaschelli, a well-known shroud skeptic, was a co-author of that paper and I find errors like this in everything he publishes on the shroud.  Yet I haven't seen his papers retracted.

Tyrer, Meacham, and Maloney at best only mention a patch, don't mention specifically use the term "invisible reweaving."

DYES

My article has many very clear photos of colored coatings on cotton and yellow fibers.  There are many more in the sources I cite.  The photos in my article clearly shroud is a darker brown color in that corner in visible images, and also appears different in spectrographic images.  Although some other areas of the shroud also appear different in the spectrographics, for unknown reasons.

ROGERS AND VANILLIN

Rogers died from cancer a month after emailing the calculations I sent you, so it's difficult to fault him for not publishing them.  But it includes the calculations that people say were never done.

Rogers 2005 says 3M "produced the tape specifically for the project; an amorphous, inert, purehydrocarbon adhesive that would not contaminate the shroud or the samples. It enabled direct chemical testing on recovered linen fibers and particulates, and the adhesive could be removed by washing with xylene."  Bella 2015 doesn't mention an issue with xylene.  I'm not a chemistry guy - do you have evidence xylene would degrade or remove vanillin?

OMISSIONS

The shroud rabbit hole is much deeper than anyone expects and full of he-said-she-said.  It takes a lot of work to sort through.  So I'm certainly not accusing you of "mustache twirling malevolence" lol.   But I am going to start using that phrase.

However, there's a multiplicity of researchers reporting cotton and/or dye in the Raes and radiocarbon samples, with many excellent microscopic and electron microscope photographs.  And only Freer-Waters+Jull among those who carefully examined that corner reporting they only found cotton but not dye, saying maybe it was a surface contaminant but not woven in--but not actually checking!  Yet even the cotton invalidates the c14 date since the rest of the shroud is linen.

I don't think it's possible to have any confidence in the c14 dating unless you can provide a very good explanation for the many vary obvious photos of cotton threads and fibers with a colored coating.
