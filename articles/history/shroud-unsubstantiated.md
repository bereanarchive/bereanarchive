## Unsubstantiated

[Max Patrick Hamon](https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/#comment-123223) claims she never examined that corner.  But in [this thread](https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/) people keep asking him for his paper and he just says it's unpublished and won't share it or any details from it, not even photos that are being debated.

## Insignificant, Uncertain, and Dubious Arguments

**Lab Samples were of different weight**

I remember this being contested but I don't remember why.

Page 61 of "The Jesus conspiracy: the Turin Shroud and the truth about the resurrection" mentions a little about this. "He worked out the loss in weight when cutting up the specimen Z1"

**Luigi Gonella said the C14 dating was an anti-catholic conspiracy:**  Luigi Gonella's obituary described him as "undisputed coordinator of, all international scientific inquiry into the Shroud – and in particular the carbon dating carried out in 1988."[^gonella-2007] Having worked with Harry Gove on the dating, the Cold Case documentary says at 49:47, that Gonella wrote in an interview in 1997, "Of course it was a conspiracy, an anti-Catholic plot."[^cold-case-2011f]

I found the referenced article in both [Italian](http://www.mondosindone.com/Site/documenti/DSS001_10%20-%20intervista%20Ballestrero.pdf) and [English](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/sn116Dec99.pdf).  Even after feeding the former through google translate, I couldn't find that statement in either.  The closest I could find was [someone else](http://www.sindone.info/VALENC-3.PDF) calling it an "anti-catholic plot" in 1988 because the scientists broke their agreement to keep quiet about the dating.

**Michael Title made a bet the carbon date would be medieval** (true, but insignificant.  The amount of the bet was small.)

#### Tapestry reweave

The 2005 book "Tapestry Conservation:  Principles and Practice" explains that reweaving could be "executed so skillfully that it is not always recognisable as a later addition."[^lennard-2005] 

But Flurry-Lemberg says tapestries use coarse fabric that makes it easier (Flerry-Lemberg-2007)

#### Misc

Gove's comment "It’s a well-known fact that scientists can produce whatever result they want.  If you believe that passionately in something, you can steer the results.  My God, we’ve all been guilty of that."

Marino slide 47 Several of the C-14 team members made public statements before the testing to the effect that ‘it’s a fake and we’re going to prove it”

"The Zurich lab noted "an odd assortment of debris, from fungi to bits of nylon" and in Tucson a thread of red silk and blue fibers were found on the sample" (Marinelli 2012).  But I can't find the sources Marinelli cites:  "The Shroud unmasked" or "How an age of mystery Ended" by David Sox.

**Cotton rare in europe before 1350**

"Cotton was almost unknown in Europe until about AD 1350,"[^rogers-2002:e] But other source say it arrived Italy in the 1100s (12th century).  Spinning wheel invented in 1350.



#### Shroud matches size of ancient cubits

But ancient cubit sizes could vary:  "A most disputed point is that of the possible relations between the Shroud's dimensions and some units of measurements known and used in ancient times."  https://www.academia.edu/2427474/Jewish_Shrouds_and_Funerary_Customs_a_Comparison_with_the_Shroud_of_Turin_in_1st_International_Congress_on_the_Holy_Shroud_in_Spain_Valencia_April_28_30_2012_ed_Centro_Espa%C3%B1ol_de_Sindonologia_CES_

#### Acts of Pilate / Gospel of Nicodemus says Jesus gave shroud to Pilate

Ctrl+F for cloth, shroud, napkin, linen, burial, and funeral in the [Gospel of Nicodemus](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelnicodemus.html) doesn't find such an account.  Even though Daniel C. Scavone says it does in [The shroud of Turin: opposing viewpoints](https://archive.org/details/shroudofturinopp00scav/page/74/mode/2up), 1989 page 74.

## Mending

I can't find this source: 

> Some also knew that in 1998, Turin’s own scientific advisor, Piero Savarino, wrote, “extraneous substances found on the samples and the presence of extraneous thread (leftover from ‘invisible mending’ routinely carried on in the past on parts of the cloth in poor repair).”  https://shroudstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/slouching-towards-emmaus-1.pdf

## Carbon dating

### Villareal's FTIR Cotton

Robert Villareal originally published

> The ToF-SIMS results were the first to show that the spectra from the two ends were similar to cotton rather than linen (flax)... The results of the FTIR analysis on all three threads [first plus two additional]... led to identification of the fibers as cotton and definitely not linen (flax).

But at the St. Lous Shroud conference in 2015 he had doubts:

>  12:25, "It's a mystery as to how we can get any anything to agree with these samples if we don't know all those items and all those parameters and and so this is a for modern samples there are special features and that differentiate what the spectra is going to look like and and it can be highly variable and so knowing that when we got these samples we would analyze them and we had every modern instrument that the world knows and and would get different results from different instruments and it's a very difficult thing and I just wanted to point that out that in doing analysis is not so straightforward."

### Sample size mismatches:

"This paper should not be taken too seriously. The sample area of the 1988 radiocarbon dating is NOT a rectangle. Therefore, the very simple calculation of 8.1 cm x 1.6 cm for the area of the sample cannot be correct, whatever the width and length used."  https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/23/paper-chase-the-shroud-of-turin-and-its-radiodating/

### Arizona's piece was cut in two but they received One Piece.

There's way too many conflicting reports from Arizona lab personnell about whether they recieved one piece or two.

" (This is contested!) The sample sent to the Arizona AMS lab had been cut in two pieces.  But Arizona lab founder Paul Damon describes receiving a single piece in the shape of a rectangle, evidenced by his photographs and corroborated by his colleague L.J. Toolin.  However Douglas Donahue, the lab's other founder, insisted no photos had been taken.==1997 catholic paper"== (but elsewhere reported two pieces recived.)

### Arizona's piece had a different warp/weft count than the shroud.

Fanti? counted the warp/weft from the photo's in Jull's paper and it was correct.  Jull just got them reversed.

### Repaired by Margaret of Austria in 1530

Me:  This seems too speculative.  There's no record of her bequeathing only a portion of the shroud, the existence of a separate portion of the shroud, or of a repair being made at that time.

Joe Marino:  "Although a repair was made in 1694, Sue and I didn't believe that's when the "invisible reweave" occurred. Margaret of Austria owned the Shroud in the 1500s. In 1508  she made our her will that at least a portion of the Shroud should go to a certain church in France. She had access to the finest weavers in  France. She died in 1530 so we surmised the invisible repair could have been made shortly after that. See our paper at: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/benfordmarino.pdf."

"during the time period of 1520-1560, which we posit as including the year in which the undetected repair was made to the corner of the Shroud used for the C-14 dating, between thirty and forty master weavers were prominently known throughout France (Campbell, 2002b: 462)."

"Margaret had in her inventory of goods “La pourtraiture du sainct suaire de NS. Fetes en toile,” ["The portrait of the Holy Shroud of Our Savior done on a towel {or cloth}]," (Tremayne, 1908: 319)"

"Margaret . . . exercised an important influence over the development of the Netherlands tapestry industry during a crucial phase of its development."

"(Note that she did not will just a piece of the Shroud but apparently the whole cloth.) However, as history records, the St. Nicholas church in Brou never received the Shroud or even a piece of the cloth. "

"Instead, we posit that Cardinal de Gorrevod and Charles V reached an agreement to excise two corner pieces of the Shroud for transference to the church in Brou. This would satisfy Margaret’s desire to support her church with a prestigious relic while leaving the nearly-complete relic in the hands of the Savoy family."

"In fact, in May 1531, just a few short months after Margaret’s death, both Louis and Laurent were acknowledged for the large contributions they made for the construction of one of the Notre-Dame de Bourg chapels." Or were they just tithing money they inherited?

"Several items listed in Margaret’s inventory of religious relics, including the Shroud pieces, were never located by the Brou church officials and remain missing to this day."

## Pierre d'Arcis

Some claim that d'Arcis only meant that there was a faked copy of the real Shroud.  E.g. "[The Shroud of Turin's Earlier History:  Part Four - To Little Lirey](.https://biblearchaeology.org/research/topics/the-shroud-of-turin-carbon-dating/2332-the-shroud-of-turins-earlier-history-part-four-to-little-lirey)"   But d'Arcis [wrote](https://priory-of-sion.com/biblios/links/memorandum.html) that there shouldn't be any image on the real shroud:  "For many theologians and other wise persons declared that this could not be the real shroud of our Lord having the Saviour's likeness thus imprinted upon it, since the holy Gospel made no mention of any such imprint, while, if it had been true, it was quite unlikely that the holy Evangelists would have omitted to record it, or that the fact should have remained hidden until the present time. "
