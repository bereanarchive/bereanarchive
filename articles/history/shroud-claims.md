Open Questions
--------------

Why does the Sudarium date to 650AD? - black specks of contamination.  Rucker predicted a date of 700AD based on the neutron radiation hypothesis.

What about the other thread that was C14 dated, and the university that denies they even had the equipment to do the test?  Is it because it was done at a different university, and it was only that the professor was from the university that denies having the equipment?

## Summary

Forensic evidence from the cloth matches a large number of details known about the torture, death, and burial of Jesus Christ.

There's a lot of misinformation about the Shroud on the internet.

Antonacci, pg 8: "The Shroud of Turin is easily the most studied relic in history."

"the most widely-studied linen cloth in history"
http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/benfordmarino2008.pdf

Guy 3, 3:00, "We know more about this cloth than any other artifact."

Features of the Shroud
----------------------

### The Cloth

#### Dimensions

14 feet 3 inches long by 3 feet 7 inches wide. (4.34 x 1.10 meters).   "Now the dimensions have been authoritatively determined by Dr. Flury-Lemberg as 437 cm long by 111 cm wide." https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n51part2.pdf

1.  The Assyrian Cubit of 21.4" (or 21.6" += 0.2) was the standard in the time of Jesus. By this cubit, the Shroud is 8 cubits by 2 cubits in size. (Ant 82-83 src 92) 
1.  "The Shroud’s length and width are in even cubits, a unit of measurement not used in medieval Europe where critics say the Shroud was faked, but in ancient Israel."[here](https://patternsofevidence.com/2022/04/15/evidence-for-jesus-shroud-of-turin/)
1.  "the international unit of measurement used in Jesus’ day was the Assyrian cubit (= 21.4”); and using this, the Shroud cloth would have measured a standard 8 x 2 cubits. [here](http://epistle.us/articles/shroudofturin2.html)"

#### Manufacture

Before \~410AD the linen fibers were bleached before assembling them into a cloth, producing banding patterns as seen in the Shroud. After \~410AD linen cloths were bleached after being woven, producing a uniform color. (Guy 3, 19:30)

#### Weave

3 in one herringbone weave, spun with a Z twist. (Ant 60 src 5). "In the herringbone weave, the warp (vertical) thread passes over three weft (horizontal) threads, under one, over three, and so forth for each run of the warp thread across the loop. The next warp is offset by one, and then the next, and a twill is formed. [here](https://patternsofevidence.com/2022/04/15/evidence-for-jesus-shroud-of-turin/)

"The Shroud of Turin is made of fine linen, woven in a three-to-one herringbone pattern. The direction of the twist of the strands rules out Egypt as the country of origin and affirms Palestine."

My own words:

1.  3:1 means each vertical thread (warp) passes over 3 horizontal (weft) threads.
2.  Twill is where you offset each thread by one to make a diagonal pattern.
3.  Herringbone is a variation of a twill where you reverse the direction of the offset every so many fibers.
4.  A Z Twist means each thread has its fibers woven with their lines in the direction of the middle part of a Z. 

The Z-twist is from a "technique of spinning with two spindles was well known, not only in ancient Egypt but also in the Coptic period.6 Furthermore, although quite rarely, linen threads with a "Z" twist have been mentioned at Palmyra and in the Judean desert." [Vial, 1988](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi3839part4.pdf)

Image of the Shroud fibers. But this sample isn't wide enough to see Herringbone.

Pro:

1.  Many linen and silk cloths with a similar weave pattern have been found in antiquity. See Ant 61. It would be useful to make a table of these with What it is, age, location, material, warp, weft, and herringbone columns:
    1.  Twill was used as far back as 3400 BC.
    
    2.  Thutmes II (1450BC) had a burial wrapping with a 4:1 twill.

    3.  Seti I (1300 BC) had burial scarf with a border with a 3:1 weave.

    4.  Queen Makeri (1100BC) had a 1:3 twill bordered with a 1:10 twill.

    5.  High priest Nessita-neb-Ashir (\~1100BC) had 1:2, 1:3, and 1:6 twill.

    6.  Rameses III (1200BC) linen girdle had a 3:1 twill alternating with a 4:1
    and 5:1 pattern weave.
    
    7.  Leggings with a 2:2 herringbone twill from 800-500BC.

    8.  Twill weave linen from Egypt dated to 136 and 200AD.

    9.  Some from Palmyra between 0-200AD with 3:1 twill.

    10. Silk herringbone examples in Syria between 250-276AD.

        1.  Sidenologist Emanuela Marinelli: "This weave pattern originated in
            Mesopotamia or Syria and was known in the Middle East at the time of
            Jesus.
    
2.  Small particles of cotton present between the linen fibers was Gossypium herbaceum, which is only found in the Middle East. Cotton weaving began in the middle east by the 7th century BC. (Ant 63 src 23) No actual cotton fibers/threads were found anywhere except in the repair corner (Schwortz)

3.  Unlike cotton, no particles of wool were found, according to the prohibition of making a garment of wool and linen in Lev 19:19 and Deut 22:11. The Mishna specified that linen and cotton could be woven together (Ant 64 src 24).

4.  The weave has much more defects than other linen cloths made in the middle ages (Ant 65 src 27)

Con

1.  [Jerry Coyne](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/):  3-in-1 herringbone weave has never been found in antiquity, only example is from the 14th century. Joe Nickel: "no examples of its complex herringbone weave are known from the time of Jesus when, in any case, burial clothes tended to be of plain weave"

2.  [Jerry Coyne](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/): Shroud has cotton fibers mixed in. Cotton and flax weren't processed at the same site until the middle ages.

3.  [Jerry Coyne](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/):  Should is "in such excellent condition," too much to be from first century.  
    1.  Shroud has been kept in ideal environment--dark surroundings with little or no moisture.
    2.  Older surviving linen cloths are known (Ant 59 src 2) E.g from Egyptian dynasties many centuries older (Ant 59 mid). 5000 year old Linen cloth at Diuropis (Ant 59 src 1) 7000 year old textile in Peru (src 3)    
    3.  "The linen shroud has never been buried in the ground. Its exceptionally good condition is in no way comparable to other shrouds which have spent hundreds of years in graves." (Flury-Lemberg 2007)

4.  [Hugh Farey on problems with the weave](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vbnt0q/comment/icfgise/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):  No ancient examples of four-shaft looms exist.
    1.  But the Gerum cloak would've been woven on a 4-shaft loom?  "The Swedish History Museums website the oldest known occurrence of houndstooth is the Gerum Cloak, a garment uncovered in a Swedish peat bog, dated to between 360 and 100 BC. Analysis of the manufacturing technique showed that it is woven in a 4-shaft twill with a color effect that create houndstoothpattern (The Swedish History Museums, n.d.)."  https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1237046/FULLTEXT01.pdf


#### Threads

Moved to notes and article.

#### Weight

"Edgerton prepared samples of linen cloth to conform to the most recent Shroud data (although her thread diameters were larger) and found an areal density of 23.7 mg cm-2 • Edgerton's result agrees remarkably well with the value 23.4 mg cm-2 that Timossi [68] derived earlier using essentially this same approach." [Schwalbe-1982](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Physics Chemistry of Shroud Schwalbe Rogers 1981 OCRsm.pdf)

#### Side Seam

1.  Seam sown on side consists of same cloth as main shround (Ant 62 src 18)
2.  The stitching pattern of the side seam matches hems of cloths found in the
    Jewish fortress of Masada, destroyed in 73AD (Ant 63 src 20-21)
3.  Flurry-Lemberg concludes that the Shroud and side seam were completed in one
    working process (Ant 155 src 11)
4.  "The radiograph, shown in Fig. 7, suggests that the side strip either is, or at least was, at one time an integral portion of the full cloth. In this particular area, there are alternating high- and low-material-density "bands" that evidently correspond to weft lots of different weight used in the weaving."  [https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Physics%20Chemistry%20of%20Shroud%20Schwalbe%20Rogers%201981%20OCRsm.pdf](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Physics Chemistry of Shroud Schwalbe Rogers 1981 OCRsm.pdf)

#### Condition

1.  Mark Antonacci, "While there are cloths that are older than 2,000 years, I'm not aware of any that are as  large as the Shroud and in as excellent condition." (Ant 138)
1.  Dr. Kitty Little proposes that gamma or neutron radiation would strengthen the linen by breaking and reforming molecular bonds in the non-crystalline regions of the cellulose. (Ant 138 src 14)
    2.  [Flurry-Lemberg 2007](https://shroud.com/pdfs/n65part5.pdf):  "The linen shroud has never been buried in the ground. Its exceptionally good condition is in no way comparable to other shrouds which have spent hundreds of years in graves."

 

#### Isotopes match middle east

> recent testing on several threads from the Shroud of Turin have provided a strong indication that the flax used to make the linen was grown in the the Middle East,

### The Body and Wounds

#### Pro

##### General Anatomy

1.  The height of the man was between 5'9" and 5'10". (Ant 84, 99-100)
2.  The wounds line up with Jesus' wounds location.  Hard for a forger to check if that was happening beneath a cloth wrapping a real body?

##### Jewish Ethnicity

1.  Harvard world renowned ethnologist Carlton S. Coon: The man on the Shroud was definitely "of a physical type found in modern times among Sephardic Jews." (Ant 81, bottom)
    
2.  Long unbound pigtail in back is typical for Jewish men of ancient times, but not Greco-Roman men. (Ant 81 src 85)
    1.  Werner Bulst S.J: "Of the numerous portraits we have of Greek and Roman origin, there is not one of a man with hair parted in the middle and falling to the shoulders. (Ant 82 src 86)
    
    2.  Roman men were almost always cleanshaven while Jewish men had Beards
        (Ant 82 src 87)
    
    3.  "In Talmudic times, when a man was to be buried, his hair was cut (M. Ḳ. 8b). This custom seems to be no longer followed."  https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7061-hair
    
3.  Chin band to keep mouth closed, as seen on the Shroud, is a Jewish custom (Ant 82 src 88-89). The Mishnah also describes this procedure (Ant 87 src

4.  Skeletal remains found among the Essenes at Qumram between 200BC to 70AD were laid on their backs with elbows at side and hands over pelvic region (Ant 82 src 90)

5.  A single long shroud also matches ancient Jewish burial customs. In the Jerusalem Talmud, Kilaim 9:32b, Juda the Patriarch who compiled the Mishnah (late 2nd century) "was buried in one linen shroud (without any other garments)." (Ant 82, src 91) The apocrypha also records single linen burial cloths (Ant 83 src 93)
    
6.  Romans cremated and Egyptians wrapped their dead in bandages.

7.  Roman execution in Israel began in 6AD when Jewish King Archaelaus (son of Herod 1st) was replaced with a Roman Procurator. But Jews were still allowed to bury those executed until 66AD. (Ant 83, mid, src 95) 
    1.  Yehoanan was buried in a tomb in Jerusalem after being crucified.
    
8.  The body was not washed before being placed in the shroud, consistent with a Jewish burial with major wounds and the rush to bury before sunset. (Ant 86
    src 106)

9.  The Mishnah states objects could be placed over the eyes to keep them closed (Ant 87 src 114).

##### Bones visible as if an x-ray:

1.  Bones in the palm are clearly visible (Ant 54 src 17-18)

2.  Also visible are features from the skull, the curved thumb beneath the left palm, teeth, and backbone including individual vertebrae and pedicles. (Ant

    1.  Only features near the surface seem visible.

##### Blood tests:

1.  Adler has done some of the most extensive work on the blood.  "the mineral simulated blood pattern is a complete mismatch except for the presence of protein." (Addler 1996)
2.  More than 15 different tests confirm the blood on the Shroud is real. The blood marks penetrate into the cloth causing the fibers to stick and mat together. (Ant 18 top, src 1)
3.  "The thing which immediately strikes a surgeon... is the definite appearance of blood congealed on the skin, borne by all the blood marks": Dr. Barbet in the 1930s. (Ant 32 src 45)
4.  Studies show the bloodstained fibers have bilirubin, bile pigments, serum type proteins (such as albumin) and nonheme proteins adjacent to the bloodstains. UV photographs show "every single blood wound shows a distinct serum clot retraction ring." This is consistent with actual bleeding wounds.
    (Ant 33, src 48-49, Adler 1996) 
    1.  Bilirubin discussion with Barry Schwortz [here.](https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/28/is-bilirubin-still-accepted-as-an-explanation-for-the-red-blood/)
    2.  "golden yellow coated fibers" on "margins of blood areas" in table 2 [here](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Chemical%20Investigation%20%20Heller%20Adler%201981%20OCR.pdf).  Table 5 shows various positive blood tests.
5.  The bloodstained areas match the spectral characteristics of human
    hemoglobin (Ant 33 src 52)
6.  The blood is of type AB and contains human immunoglobulins (Ant 33 src 53)
7.  The blood contains X and Y chromosomes and is very degraded, consistent with ancient DNA (Ant 33 src 54)
8.  The blood is still red, and looks redder in the sun. (Ant 18 bottom src 2)
9.  No scabs, indicating man died before they could form. (Ant 36)
10.  "a high level of creatinine and ferritin is related to patients suffering of strong polytrauma like torture. Hence, the presence of these biological nanoparticles found during our TEM experiments point a violent death for the man wrapped in the Turin shroud." Elvio Carlino et al. *"*[Atomic resolution studies detect new biologic evidences on the Turin Shroud](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180487)."  PLoS One. 2017.
11.  Shroud conf 2017 paper says blood zapped with high intensity short laser makes it more red.  But it only comes out after waiting 4ish years.
12.  Giulio Fanti [says](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1296207417300092?via%3Dihub) the blood's redness has been reinforced by pigments.
13.  This page has some photos of the blood:  http://www.sindonology.org/photomicrographs.shtml

##### Scourge marks:

1.  Ant 18 src 5: The man's back from shoulders to lower legs are covered with
    at least 100 scourge marks. They run in parallel and diagonal across the
    body in groups of two or three. All are about the same size but they vary in
    intensity, and many have blood in them (src 4)
    1.  But William Guy says 372 blood stains from flagra ([Part 1,
        25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0JBberCqw4))

2.  Ant 20: The barbell shaped wounds match the Roman flagrum, which had pellets
    of lead or bone at the end of a pair of leather thongs. (src 5, 6)
    1.  But this guy says we really don't know what roman flagrum looked like:  https://brill.com/view/journals/jshj/15/1/article-p1_1.xml?language=en&ebody=full%20html-copy1
    1.  Possible response by William Meacham here?  https://www.academia.edu/89911497
    
3.  Ant 66-67: The flagrum was not common anywhere except Roman culture, and a
    flagrum matching the scourge marks on the shroud was found in Herculaneum
    (neighbors Pompeii) from 79AD. Jews would have stopped scourging at 39
    lashes.

4.  Ant 20: A halo of lighter color surrounds the marks, which has tested
    chemically and with UV light to be blood serum (src 7) This matches a
    process called syneresis (src 8), where a blood clot retracts as it
    coagulates, leaving the serum on the outside. The serum fluorescing borders
    and other small scratches can only be seen under UV light, not invented for
    several centuries after the middle ages. (ant 21 top)

5.  Ant 20, bottom: The indented centers and raised edges of the scourge marks
    aren't visible with the naked eye, only when photographed and viewed under a
    microscope.

6.  Roman citizens were forbidden from being scourged (or crucified?),
    indicating the man on the Shroud was not a Roman citizen.

##### Face and head wounds:

1.  Cheeks appear swollen and area below the right cheek has a triangle shaped
    wound (Ant 21 mid, src 9)
2.  Nose may have slight deviation showing cartilage separated (ant 21, src 10)
3.  Microscopic scratches and dirt are on the nose (ant 21, src 11)
4.  There are about 30 scalp wounds (ant 22, src 12) matching what would be
    expected from a cap made of thorns (src 13) The types blood flow from these
    wounds corresponds to the locations of arteries and veins on the head (Ant
    23, src 14-17). That arterial and venous blood flows occurred differently
    was not discovered until 1593. Images from the 15th century (Ant 24, fig
    1.  show how poorly bloodflow was understood in those times.
5.  A clot on the man's forehead follows a path in the shape of a reverse "3",
    consistent with the forehead muscles contracting due to pain (Ant 24, src
6.  "the Shroud man wore a ‘cap’ rather than a ‘crown’ of thorns, which no medieval artist would have known about or depicted." [here](http://epistle.us/articles/shroudofturin1.html)

##### Hand / wrist wounds:

1.  The man's left wrist has been pierced. Although the right wrist is beneath
    the left wrist and not visible, blood flows can be seen coming from both
    wrists flowing toward the elbows, indicating the man's arms were elevated
    after the wounds occurred.

2.  Art through the centuries nearly unanimously portrays Jesus being pierced
    through the hands, not the wrists. (Ant 25). But the Greek word includes
    both hands and wrists (src 20-21)

3.  Yehohanan was pierced between the radius and ulna (two bones of the forearm,
    not wrist) (Ant 26, src 22)

4.  Autopsy surgeon Pierre Barber noted than when a nail is driven into the
    wrist, it often finds its way into the Space of Destot, widening this space
    by pushing aside four small bones and forming a strong anchor from which to
    hang a man. Driving a nail into this spot stimulates the medain nerve,
    causing the thumb to contract as seen on the hands on the Shroud image. (Ant
    27 src 25)

5.  No artwork of Jesus has ever depicted the wounds in the wrist with the thumbs absent or contracted (At 27 src 26)
    
6.  Blood flows on the arms are at 55 and 65 degree angles. A man would need to
    raise himself 10 degrees on a cross to breathe (Ant 24-25 src 19)

##### Injuries from carrying crossbeam:

1.  The back side shroud image shows two areas on the shoulders that are chafed raw. Scourge marks within this area differ than those elsewhere indicating this happened after the scourging (Ant 28 src 27-28)
    
2.  White light photos and UV florescent lighting also show scratches on the front of the man's knees. (Ant 28 src 29-30). Microscopic examination of the shroud shows dirt on the front of the man's knees nose, and bottom of the feet (ant 28 src 31). This is consistent with the man being unable to break
    his fall when carrying the crossbeam.

##### Foot wounds:

1.  The feet have two large blood marks consistent with a nail being driven through them for crucifixion, with the image present on both the front and back of the Shroud. The larger wound has a border that fluoresces under UV light. Some of the blood runs toward the toes but most flows toward the
    heels, consistent with the man being vertical (on a cross) and then horizontal afterward. (Ant 29-30 src 35-38)
2.  The left knee was flexed, consistent with the right knee being placed directly against a surface and the left foot placed on top. (Ant 30, bottom)
3.  The nail goes through the heel, consistent with Yohannan but inconsistent with medieval art.  BBC 50:10.

##### Chest Wound

1.  Has the largest concentration of blood on the Shroud. (Ant 31)

2.  All medical authorities agree this occurred from a post-mortem wound. The
    blood flowed due to gravity, not from a pumping heart, and there is no
    swelling surroundign the wound. (Ant 31)

3.  The side wound contains a clear watery fluid. (Ant 31 src 40) Although views
    differ, most medical experts believe the blood came from the heart and
    watery fluid from the pleural cavity in the chest (Ant 32 src 42-43)

4.  The wound was created by an elliptical lesion about 4.4x1.1cm in size,
    matching the lancea spear used by Roman foot soldiers. (Ant 31 src 41)

    1.  But NewGeology says it matches the Roman Hasta.

    2.  But Ant 67 mid says the hasta was designed to break off inside the body,
        and the wound on the shroud doesn't match any other weapon (pg 67, near
        bottom, src 31)

5.  Origen says Romans usually stabbed victims on the right side, just below the
    armpit. (Ant 67 src 32)

6.  John uses the word "lanka" for the word speak, which is Greek for the latin
    word Lancea. ([William Guy part 2, at
    27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0wsbxJGuus))

7.  Anthony Sava (cardiothoracic surgeon). Took questionnaire of other thoracic
    surgeons (as well as his own experience) and noted that violence to the rib
    cage without an open wood causes an accumulation of fluid in the pleural
    cavity (fluid between lungs and chest wall) from ruptured capillaries. It
    then separates into a lighter fluid above and a lighter material below. So
    being stabbed would release the dark material then the light fluid. (Wiliam
    Guy part 2, 28:00)

##### Face

See my [debate with Gunter](https://www.facebook.com/erics.username.4/posts/pfbid0F2AhAae8mzuUh9YDYgFjXKzLdHqoBhjMx1ZH2znL5xk2T8ivQBt9qeWWj6hLH6UGl?comment_id=582240923449956&__cft__[0]=AZXTvPvTLw7lPfERsfJcjealS8khcBSVm9ahZIhPEWlMmEBvFjI45Ys9v4GpqeeNSEXUCQuKmUhWl-wUrPgkELhFuYR_XGcbVoib1F8N0ytGqxDPtcCp14iziEKApg-4DsIoiHAAA4bFfn7UlWslikTwb6dk6lnPethiYuKmUYz9cw&__tn__=R]-R):  "I looked deeply into the research on the shroud and here is why I am very skeptical: the body image has incorrect and impossible anatomical features: the eyes are positioned far too high, which would imply a chimp sized brain capsule; the position of the hands crossed over the hips is impossible in a relaxed state (try yourself). Both features (too high eyes and too long arms) are typical for 13-14th century paintings (gothic). Therefore, irrespective of the carbon dating I see no way the shroud could be authentic."  

"I laid on my couch and I put my arms at the same place over my hips to reproduce the position in the shroud image, but my choreography skills are much worse than average. Moreso I can adjust the position of my arms over my hips depending on the incline on which I lay. I'm also not sure if we're dealing with a dislocated shoulder on the shroud image.  I agree the eyes appear high on the image, but perhaps only very very slightly. It seems like we should expect some distortions depending on how the linen falls over the body. Given that, the blurred nature of the image, and possibly different angles of the neck, is it even possible to get the precision you'd need for such an anatomical analysis?"

Günter Bechly:  "I bet that you had to lift your shoulders to cross your hands over the hips. That‘s why I emphasized „relaxed position“ (as in a corpse after rigor mortis faded).
Concerning the eye position: you cannot use photos with distorted perspective (depending of camera angle, focal length, and head position) for comparison with an image that was made either in contact or very close distance. In every portrait painting class you first learn that the eyes are located at about 50% of the head (most amateurs, kids, and gothic painters tend to place them much higher)."

Me: "I finally got to a place where I could repeat my death pose, this time with relaxed shoulders.  Here's what I found:

\1.  Laying flat on the floor and relaxing my shoulders, the weight of my elbows definitely DID pull my arms down to where my hands were no longer crossing at all.
\2.  When laying on some pillows with my waist bent at perhaps a 15 degree incline, the weight of my elbows could just barely separate my crossed hands.

However:

\1.  If I was wrapped in a sheet I could imagine it preventing the weight of my elbows from separating my hands.
\2.  Rigor mortis will be in effect from about 3 hours to 36 hours after death, plus or minus 24 hours[1] and Jesus was likely dead for roughly 36 hours.

On the eyes:  I'm really struggling to accept that we have enough data to say the image on the shroud is outside the normal range of human variation.  Even a slight bulge or indentation in the linen cloth as it lays between the nose and the forehead could distort the face.  Despite that the shroud face looks like it has very normal proportions to me.  And the face I compared it with looks like he's looking straight at me without the neck up or down, and at enough distance to not have the close-up "selfie" distortion.

##### Other

1.  Rib cage is expanded, pectoral muscles drawn toward collarbone, consistent
    with hanging on a cross (Ant 34 src 56, Ant 35 src 63)

2.  The muscles show rigor mortis, which can happen immediately after death if
    preceded by strenuous activity or in a hot climate. (Ant 35 src 58-60,
    62-63). Signs of rigor mortis:

    1.  Left leg to be raised and feet kept in their awkward position.
        Indicating rigor mortis set in while the man was on the cross (Ant 35
        src 61)

    2.  thighs, buttox, and torso on back image are not flat (Ant 35 src 62)

    3.  Chin drawn tot eh chest and turned slightly to the right (src 63)

    4.  Pectoral muscles drawon toward the collarbone and arms -- indicating
        rigor mortis begaon on the cross. (src 65)

    5.  Thumbs turned inward. (src 66)

3.  Decomposition begins 2-3 days after death, but no chemical signatures of
    decomposition have been found on the cloth. (Ant 44)

4.  Other than the blood and chest fluid, no chemical traces of perspiration,
    urea, or other body fluids have been found on the cloth (Ant 44 src 7)

5.  Legs not broken, matches John 19:34, Psalm 34:19-20.

6.  Constantine banned the type of curcifixion seen on the Shroud in 315 (Ant
    69, no src).

 

#### Con

1.  [History Today](http://www.historytoday.com/charles-freeman/origins-shroud-turin):
    1973 study found no potassium found in the shroud's blood. Too red to be dried blood. Most likely animal collagen from rabbit skin glue used in medieval paintings."

2.  [History Today](http://www.historytoday.com/charles-freeman/origins-shroud-turin):
    Walter McCrone found "vermilion on the bloodstains and red ochre for the main part of the bodies."
    1.  [NewGeology](https://www.newgeology.us/presentation24.html):  "some microscopic particles of paint exist on the Shroud, but these do not constitute the image.  During the Middle Ages, a practice called the "sanctification of paintings" permitted about 50 artists to paint replicas of the Shroud and then lay their paintings over the Shroud to "sanctify" them.  This permitted contact transfer of particles, which then migrated around the cloth with the folding and rolling of the Shroud when it was opened for exhibit and closed again afterwards."
    2.  Addler 1996:  "several of these painted copies were "sanctified" by being pressed to the original."

3.  [History Today](http://www.historytoday.com/charles-freeman/origins-shroud-turin):
    STURP found large amounts of ground chalk, "a major ingredient in the Middle
    Ages north of the Alps."

4.  "Paul Vignon and Pierre Barbet found, after many attempts, that it was
    impossible to transfer blood to a linen cloth with anything like the
    precision shown on the shroud. If the blood were too wet when it came into
    contact with the cloth, it would spangle or run in all directions along the
    threads. If it were not wet enough, it would likely leave only a smudge. The
    perfect-bordered, picture like clots on the shroud, it seemed, could not be
    reproduced by staining." (Ant 39 src 1)
5.  Could the body have been washed first?. Acts 9:37 shows this was customary. But Ant 85 argues this was forbidden when there were major blood wounds.

6.  Blood transferred by radiation as Antonacci proposes?

7.  Many of the blood marks would not have been in contact with the cloth. E.g.
    those on the back of the upraised leg, small of the back, the spine, above
    the shoulder blades, back sides of the head, and at the top of the shoulders
    near the neck. (Antonacci 47-48)

    1.  Could the shroud have just been placed tightly against these areas? But
        the blood marks would have been altered by pressing against them.
        Especially the microscopic serum halos?

    2.  What if he was laying on sand?

8.  The direction of blood flow on the arms are "[totally unrealistic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1556-4029.13867) " for a crucifixion victim.  But a plastic manequin has a different profile than dirty, swollen, and lacerated sweaty skin.   [But](https://www.uccronline.it/eng/2018/07/28/shroud-of-turin-silence-from-borrini-and-garlaschelli-on-rebuttals-to-their-study/) "On the plastic mannequin they poured a bag of blood added with an anticoagulant, which made the liquid more fluid than normal, similar to water (this can be clearly seen in the video they published). The blood come out of the Shroud’s Man, instead, outflew from wounds and had not been prepared in a lab, which is why it presented itself as viscous, also in consideration of the traumatic stress he had undergone (the shroud image shows the signs of the torture suffered by the man)." and "they did not consider that the corpse of the Shroud’s Man has been certainly touched after his death, came into contact with the very linen cloth in which the Man’s image was mysteriously imprinted like a photographic negative (by colouring, inexplicably], only the superficial fibrils). Furthermore, the Man certainly had spasms and foreseeably moved because of pain whilst wounds were inflicted. These variables have certainly deviated, obstructed, or interrupted the “normal” dripping or pathway of the blood on his body. None of this was considered by the two researchers."  See pictures here:  https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/11/new-garlaschelli-and-borrini-study/#comment-196050.  Also  track down all of this debate:  [Shroud of Turin: silence from Borrini and Garlaschelli on rebuttals to their study](https://www.uccronline.it/eng/2018/07/28/shroud-of-turin-silence-from-borrini-and-garlaschelli-on-rebuttals-to-their-study/)

9.  Dr. M. M. Baden says the the shroud is wrong to show blood trickling from the scalp, because the blood from a scalp wound doesn't flow in rivulets, but rather mats the hair. ([ReligiousTolerance.org](http://www.religioustolerance.org/analysis-of-the-shroud-of-turin.htm)).

10.  "Claims that the blood in the "bloodstains" is type AB *"are nonsense"*, according to Ray Rogers, a retired research chemist and member of STURP (Rogers 2004)."
     ([SillyBeliefs.com](http://www.sillybeliefs.com/shroud.html#heading-1e))

### Anatomy

Also see sections above.

1.  "There are serious anatomical problems with the image. Jesus' face, body,
    arms, and fingers were unnaturally thin and elongated (like figures in
    Gothic art), his left forearm was longer than his right, and his right hand
    is too long. The man is impossibly tall, being 6ft 8in (2.03m). The head is
    disproportionately small for the body, the face unnaturally narrow and the
    forehead foreshortened, and ears lost. The front and back images, in
    particular of the head, do not match up precisely, and the back image is
    around 2 inches (5cm) longer than the front. The back of the head is wider
    than the front of the head."
    ([SillyBeliefs.com](http://www.sillybeliefs.com/shroud.html#heading-1e))
    1.  Psalm 22:14, "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint."
    2.  Jesus may have been laying on an incline.
    3.  The fingers are like an xray and you see fingers inside the hand.

From shroud skeptic Garlaschelli:  "The accuracy of the anatomy of the Man of the Shroud has been debated many times. Some researchers consider it perfect and flawless,35 others think it looks unnatural. According to Frederick Zugibe,36 it may even show evidence that Jesus suffered from Marfan’s Syndrome, a rare hereditary disease having among its symptoms elongated limbs, long spidery fingers, and a long thin face. Since the image is fuzzy and ruined by burns, it is very doubtful whether accurate anthropometric measurements are possible (for example, in the front image the feet do no even show); thus, the question remains unclear." Life-size Reproduction of the Shroud of Turin and its Image, 2010



> Essene burials show skeletons in the same position as the image on the Shroud, "laid out flat. facing upward, elbows bent slightly and hands crossed on the pelvis" [[23\]](https://pravoslavie.ru/81330.html#23a); "the protruding elbows rule out an Egyptian-type of mummified burial "[[24\]](https://pravoslavie.ru/81330.html#24a) in which the arms are tightly bound at the sides.  https://pravoslavie.ru/81330.html

 

### Sudarium

1.  The word Sudarium is a loan word from Latin and means a small cloth used to wipe away sweat, like a handkerchief. It's used this way in Luke 19:20 and Acts 19:12. John describes a sudarium tied around the face of Lazarus (11:44) and one around the face of Jesus (20:7). A cloth wrapped around the chin and over the head to hold the jaw shut is consistent with this definition, as others have suggested.  "[New English Translation Notes](https://lumina.bible.org/bible/John+20:7)."   Note on John 20:7: "[Raymond] E. Brown speculates that it was wrapped under the chin and tied on top of the head to prevent the mouth of the corpse from falling open but this is not certain." and "Proceedings of the 1977 United States Conference of Research on the Shroud of Turin." Holy Shroud Guild. 1977.
2.  A jaw band might be visible on the Shroud image, with bands being seen along the side of the face, an upturned beard, and hair on the left side of the face draped over an invisible object. (Ant 88 src 118.)
3.  Blood marks correspond to Shroud (Guy 3, 1:00) (But where? Around the chin?)
4.  Same blood type as Shroud, AB (Common in middle east, but only 5% of the population elsewhere) (Guy 3, 1:00)
5.  Pollen indicates it was in Palestine (Guy 3, 1:00)
6.  Radiocarbon dates to the 7th century. (Guy 3, 1:50). Repair hypothesis can't explain this. It's either other contamination or neutron radiation. Bob Rucker predicted it would date to the 7th century based on neutron radiation hypothesis?

 

"In fact that sudarium disproves the Shroud of Turin because thats an example of how real blood spreads on a cloth and becomes a dark brown unlike the bright red shroud "bloodstains"." https://www.amazon.com/J/product-reviews/B0045UB5W8/

### Image Features

There's no image beneath the blood marks. A forger would need to apply the blood
first and then create the image. But then how would the wounds line up perfectly
with where blood vessels would be in the image?

#### 3D Image

Pro:

1.  Antonacci, pg 4, bottom: Shading in front image correlates precisely with
    cloth-body distance.

2.  Antonacci, pg 5, top: "True three-dimensional distance information had never
    been encoded before on a two-dimensional image." (in the middle ages or
    prior)

3.  Antonacci, pg 8-9: 3D depth information is straight vertical. "Only a
    vertical encoding direction from the body to the cloth also resulted in an
    anatomically reasonable, three-dimensional body image such as that on the
    Shroud." See source 7&8.

4.  The face has the most contrast because faces have sharper changes in depth.

5.  Antonaccy, pg 9, bottom: John Heller: "It is as if every pore and every hair
    of the body contained a microminiature laser."

6.  Antonacci, pg 10, top: Distance information is correct even where the Shroud
    wouldn't have touched the body.

7.  Darker colored areas consist of a greater number of fibers being colored,
    not the fibers being colored more intensely. (Ant 56, top)

8.  There's a lack of 2D image (Ant 89 bottom)

9.  The 3D image is distorted where there are blood marks because they cover the
    body image.

Con:

1.  [Dan Porter](https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/it-is-really-really-time-to-rethink-what-we-think-about-3d/):
    Says death mask photos also recreate 3D information. (But look at the
    photos, the shadow beneath the nose would indicate a deep pit, and the top
    lip much further back than the bottom white lip). But Porter also says of
    the Shroud, "I still think the data is real 3D data."
2.  Dan Porter also here:  https://shroudstory.com/2019/03/10/the-myth-of-the-vp8-and-3d-uniqueness/  But are there medieval examples of such images?

#### No Brush Strokes

Pro:

1.  Image specialists Lynn and Lorre did direction analysis on the photos, and
    only detected the directions of the weave. No brush strokes (Ant 5-6 src 5)

#### Coloration of Fibers

Pro:

1.  The image adds no density to the fibers (so it's not added material).  [Barrie Schwortz](https://youtu.be/Mke8mUKosaY?t=1h6m0s).
2.  Antonacci, pg 10-11: Only topmost fibers of each thread are darker. And only the outside of those fibers, 360 degrees around them. Each fiber is white on the inside. Src 12.
3.  It's stable to heating up to a temperature where the cloth itself becomes scorched. (Ant 96 src 1)
4.  The coloration of the body image is stable water, neither impeding or altering the flow of water. The water stains don't affect the image. If the image were a paint or powder this is especially surprising, since only the outer layers of the fibers are colored--the image doesn't penetrate the cloth.
5.  Neither the chemical components of the body image nor the scorch marks could be dissolved with numerous acetic acids, oxidants, reducing agents, and organic solvents. (Ant 97 src 7)
6.  Coloration is not from any pigments, powders, dyes, or materials of any kind. (Ant 11 src 13).
7.  Coloration is from oxidized dehydrated cellulose. Schwalbe, L.A. et al. "[Physics and chemistry of the shroud of turin: A summary of the 1978 Investigation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267001852636)."  
    "the image is the result of some cellulose oxidation—dehydration reaction
    rather than an applied pigment."
8.  Coloration is not from scorching.  Rogers 2002 discusses this extensively.
9.  The cloth fluoresces under UV light but not the body image (Ant 97 src 3)
10.  Lightly scorched areas of the Shroud (from the fire?) closely resemble Shroud body image fibers (Ant 97 src 5), as well as having a similar microscopically corroded appearance and a lower tensile strength (src 6).
11.  Controlled timing of heat can produce superficial scorches on the shroud
     linen similar to the body image. (Ant 97 src 4) Heat is known to darken
     cellulose (Ant 97 src 9)
12.  Dr. Luigi Goella, scientific advisor to the Custodian of the Shroud:
     "...whatever the mechanism might be, it must be such to yield effects as if
     it were a burst of collimated [parallel beams of] radiant energy." (Ant 98
     src 12)
13.  Radiation causes single bonded carbon and oxygen atoms to break apart from
     their hydrogen and double bond to one another. (Ant 12 src 16).
14.  The shroud is a negative image (more specifically a heightmap) and these
     weren't discovered until the 20th century.
15.  [NewGeology](https://www.newgeology.us/presentation24.html): "peculiar structure, size and distribution of the iron oxide nanoparticles found on the fiber exclude ancient dyes for painting which are in general, on the scale of hundreds of nanometers. Red ochre and vermillion organic and inorganic particles have sizes at least one hundred times bigger than those observed here."
16.  Dr. Kitty Little, retired nuclear physicist from Britain's Atomic Energy
     Research Establishment: "that the source of the illumination that had formed
     the image came from within--that is from the body--... as a whole... Now it
     seemed almost certain that the image must have been caused by some sort of
     radiation... However there was one source of ionizing radiation that they
     did not try." (Ant 100 src 15-16)
     1.  Before hearing about the Shroud, in the 1950s Little had irradiated
         linen fiber at the nuclear reactor in Harwell, which became straw
         yellow.

     2.  This is only consistent with radiation originating from within the body,
         because the body's near-surface skeletal features are seen on the
         Shroud.
17.  Biophysicist Jean-Baptiste Rinaudo of the Center for Nuclear Medical
     Research in Montpellier, France irradiated linen with proton beams, which
     caused their natural fluorescence to disappear. Only the top layer of the
     linen became discolored, and did so from double carbon bonds.(Ant 101 src
     1.  When heated at low temperatures to simulate aging, the image became
         darker. (Ant 102 src 22)

18.  ["A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00085030.1981.10756882)" by Adler is called one of the most authoritative papers on what does and doesn't constitute the shroud image.

19.  "the image is the result of some cellulose oxidation—dehydration reaction
     rather than an applied pigment."  Schwalbe, L.A. et al. "[Physics and chemistry of the shroud of turin: A summary of the 1978 Investigation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267001852636)."  


Con:

1.  Third comment [here](https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/17/the-turin-shroud-image-is-not-a-scorch/) says coloration can be duplicated chemically: "Rogers had succeeded in coloring a sample of Edgerton cloth treated with dextrin and saponaria, and exposing it to ammonia for about 10 minutes." and "Ray Rogers had succeeded in removing the image coloration on a TS fibre using diimide revealing an unaffected fibre underneath."

#### Art Style

"Even just looking at it, the face has identifiable elongated medieval proportions, entirely consistent with the figures of Jesus, John the Baptist, or Old Testament prophets that stare down at us from medieval buildings."[2]

Shows Jesus being more beat up than other art in history.

Face matches earliest depictions of Jesus in art.

Byzantine coins match the image on the shroud though. Bob Rucker argues that they were copied from the Shroud.

[Habermas](https://youtu.be/m_uQTXYMUqI?t=11m4s): "Philip McNair has studied hundreds of pieces of medieval crucifixion art. All of them have nail marks in the palm, not the wrist."

"But to recognize the image, one must be six or eight feet back from the Shroud. Any closer and the image on the cloth is lost. This fact further argues against a forger. How could such an image be created by someone working up close?" [here](https://patternsofevidence.com/2022/04/15/evidence-for-jesus-shroud-of-turin/)

See the picture in point 6 here:  https://reasonsforjesus.com/8-reasons-why-the-shroud-of-turin-might-be-the-burial-cloth-of-jesus/

#### Pontius Pilate Lepton Coin

I'm still not sure about this one.

1.  Greek letters CAI seen in a circular pattern from the 9:30 to 11:30 positions over the man's right eye (left eye in the mirrored photos)

    1.  Ant, 72: "All four letters are upright (not sideways, upside down, or backward); the etters appear to be side by side and match the spelling
        found on other coins minted by Pontius Pilate, and the lituus and coin margin are consistent with a genuine coin. It would be too much of a
        coincidence that these findings would appear on the 14'3" length and 3'7" width of the Shroud at the exact location over the victim's right
        eye. According to Filas, teh odds are astronomical that these things occurred by coincidence, and not from an inscription."

2.  Match the size, sequence, and rotation of what would be expected on a lepton.

3.  Coins on the eyes were a common Jewish burial practice (Ant 70, src 35-6)

    1.  A coin of Herod Agrippa I dating between 42-43BC was found in the undisturbed skull of an adult woman in the Ciaphas tomb (Ant 73, src ?)

    2.  Ant. lists more such instances on the following page.

4.  Some people say they can also see the letter "U" before CAI, a lituus (astrologer's staff) common on Pilate coins, and a clipped edge common to
    such coins, but I can't make them out.

5.  Pilate Leptons normally have the words TIOUKAICAPOC, an abbreviation of
    TIBEPIOUKAICAPOC which is "Tiberiou Kaisaros" Tiberius Caesar.

6.  After the CAI was found on the Shroud, the Pilate leptons were rechecked and
    four were found with the "CIA" misspelling. (Ant 72 src 45, personal
    communication)

7.  The Mishnah states objects could be placed over the eyes to keep them closed
    (Ant 87 src 114). Genesis 46:4 mentions that is preferable for the dead to
    have their eyes closed.

#### Flower

"Danin has identified hundreds of flowers and thorns on Shroud photos taken over a apan of more t han a century, as well as on the cloth's ultravioet florescent
photos." (Ant 81 top middle) I haven't yet found a good images of the flowers online. I might be able to use the paper linked [from here](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/08/990803073154.htm) as a source?

1.  The flower could be one of 28 species. (Ant 79 middle)

2.  27 of those species grow near Jerusalem. (Ant 79)

3.  Half of the flowers are only found in the Middle East and similar areas, but
    never in Europe. (Ant 79, src 76)

4.  All 28 plants bloom in March and April (Ant 79 src 78)

5.  Whanger says one type of flower seen on the cloth (Capparis aegyptia) blooms in the spring at around 3-4pm, and look like they had been picked 24-36
    hours before the image formed.

#### General

1.  A medieval forger would not know to add details that could not be seen apart from technology invented 500-600 years later.

#### McCrone says blood is pigments

See [his paper](http://llanoestacado.org/freeinquiry/skeptic/shroud/as/mccrone.html) and my notes on it in shroud-source-notes.md

### Residues on the Cloth

#### Limestone

1.  Limestone from the foot of the shroud matches limestone from the Ecole Biblique tomb in Jerusalem, which is in the same rock shelf as the Holy Sepulchre and the Garden Tomb.
2.  Both are travertine aragonite limestone with lesser amounts of strontium and iron. (Ant 76 src 62, 64-66)
3.  The limestone of the Shroud did not match limestone from 9 other sites tested in Israel. (ant 76 src 66)
4.  Guy 3, 4:10 - back side of shroud that would have been touching tomb has travertine aragonite limestone. Optical crystolographer Joseph Kohlbeck says the shroud has travertine aragonite limestone. Most limestone is not travertine aragonite.

#### Jerusalem soil

[Fanti](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/fantiveng.pdf):  "Moreover, many mineral particles are compatible with the Jerusalem soil."

#### Pollen

##### Pro

1. Dr. Frei studied 58 pollen grains were taken from the Shroud. (Ant 77, top)
   There were:

   1.  16 pollens found only in salty soil or sandy deserts (similar to Dead
       Sea), not found in Italy or France.

   2.  7 grains were from plants that grow in rocky terrains, similar to
       Palestine and surrounding area.

   3.  6 grains matched Antolia, Turkey, and areas between Iran and the eastern
       Mediterranan, but not Italy or France. (Ant 78 top)

   4.  45 out of 58 were non-European in origin. (Ant 78)

   5.  Only 3 types of pollen did not grow in Jerusalem (Ant 78, src 70). Two
       of those are found in Edessa, Turkey (src 71), and one is only found in
       Constantinople (Ant 78 src 72).

   6.  The Shroud would've absorbed the most pollen when it was being made.
       Linen is made of flax, and flax would've been soaked in water and then
       laid on the grass to be bleached and dry, occassionally being sprinkled
       with water, creating a sticky surface for pollen to adhere.

2. Dr. Uri Baruch (expert in Israeili pollens) found pollen from 3 thorny
   plants. One of those plants is found only in and near Israel and had 90
   pollen grains on the Shroud.

3. [Vatican Insider, 2012](http://www.lastampa.it/2012/05/24/vaticaninsider/pollen-is-evidence-that-the-holy-shroud-is-indeed-a-winding-sheet-XDgioMDXJJtBxfpfjyoSWL/pagina.html):  "this discovery is strong proof against the theory of the shroud being a medieval fake. It seems somewhat incredible (and it would be a true scientific
   miracle) that a medieval forger would have known what ointments and oils were used in Jewish funeral rites in the 1st century AD and that this same forger would have put together aromas and ointments in the knowledge that a few centuries later tools that had not yet been invented might reveal his work. ... 'Identifying the main pollen traces found on the Shroud captures a snapshot of a funeral rite that followed the customs of Asia Minor, 2000 years ago. They are the components of the most precious oils and ointments of the time and have extraordinarily remained sealed in the fabric… The correct identification of the Helichrysum’s pollen, wrongly believed to be that of the Gundelia flower, confirms and guarantees that the body wrapped up in the sheet was an important figure.'"

4. Antonacci's list of reasons why Pollen couldn't blow to Europe from the middle east (Ant 231)

   1.  Most of the pollen is from low-lying shrubs (unlikely to blow far), and is insect pollinated.
   2.  Europe is separated from the Middle East by the Mediterranean basins and large mountain ranges, creating a countervailing wind system between the two regions.
   3.  The Shroud has spent most of its history closed up in boxes.
   4.  We should expect the majority of pollen to be from Europe.

5. Fanti [concluded](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlfanti2.pdf) that Frei's pollen analysis was accurate after examining vacuumed samples from the Shroud?  "After the recent discovery from the TS vacuumed dusts of the same pollen grains detected by M. Frei [Fanti & Gaeta, Fanti & Malfi, Fanti et al. 9], it can be concluded that M. Frei's findings are reliable"

    

##### Con

1.  Some argue that Frei would only have been able to identify pollen grains by genus, not species.
2.  "Frei is probably best known for having pronounced the forged *Hitler Diaries* as genuine." ([ReligiousTolerance.org](http://www.religioustolerance.org/analysis-of-the-shroud-of-turin.htm))
3.  No olive pollen was found on the Shroud. ([SillyBeliefs.com](http://www.sillybeliefs.com/shroud.html))
4.  "32 of the 57 pollens allegedly found by Frei are from insect-pollinated plants and could not have been wind-blown onto the exposed shroud in Palestine." ([SillyBeliefs.com](http://www.sillybeliefs.com/shroud.html))
5.  "Pollen analysis carried out by STURP failed to replicate the results obtained a few years earlier by Max Frei. The team was critical of his findings and did not produce any new pollen evidence." ([BadArchaeology](http://www.badarchaeology.com/out-of-place-artefacts/mysterious-objects/turin_shroud/))

#### Burial Practice

Is a shroud around the body consistent with what the gospels describe?  Consistent with Jewish Burial practices.  See [this article](https://biblearchaeology.org/research/topics/the-shroud-of-turin/3199-some-ruminations-on-the-shroud-of-turin) by Rick Lanser in 2014.

#### Burial Spices

1.  STURP found no trace of myrhh or aloes on the Shroud. But they only had access to the inner side. Outer side has never been scientifically examined without the backing cloth (Ant 87)
    1.  Perhaps the 75 lbs of myrrh and aloe from nicodemus in John 19:40 was only left in baskets or pottery within linen cloths?  But that doesn't match John's gospel.  John says they were wrapped in the cloth 
    2.  What about the anointing of Jesus in the days before his death?
    3.  Lack of time to anoint body before Sabbath.
    4.  History is messy and often more complicated than the parts written down.  Consider the death of Judas.  Hung himself but fell headfirst?  He would've had to hit a branch on the way down, but the new testament never mentions branches.
2.  [Ray Rogers](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers5faqs.pdf):  "Biblical accounts suggested several types of compounds that might have appeared on the cloth (e.g., aloes, myrrh, sebaceous secretions, etc.). We planned and executed chemical analytical methods that could detect them in 1978. Those methods were extremely sensitive, but they did not detect squalene or myrrh. These results could have been confirmed by additional tests on the Shroud, but the "restoration" has totally changed the Shroud's surface."
3.  Archaeologist Eugenia L. Nitowski:  "Dr. Pierluigi Biama Ballone and Dr. Agostino Gaglio, on the other hand, in a 1984 article--discussed their findings of myrrh and aloes on the Shroud. In 1985, when I received the Mylar tapes and began photographing them, I too found myrrh and aloes, as shown in the comparative photos of Figures 86a and 86b; 87 and 88. The study could go no further, because of the inability to perform testing which would either remove or destroy materials from the tapes. " [https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ESSJ%20Nitowski%201986.pdf](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ESSJ Nitowski 1986.pdf) - top of page 85.
    1.  Myrhh and Aloe were also applied to walls of tombs:  "The mixed substance had been applied to walls and the bodies."  [https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ESSJ%20Nitowski%201986.pdf](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ESSJ Nitowski 1986.pdf) - middle of page 85.
    2.  Pages 90 and 91 show some photos of aloe and myrhh from the shroud.
    3.  But [Sue Benford](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/benfordmarino2008.pdf):  "Along with the lack of any chemical characterization of the debris, the fact that the singular yarn (1FH) with the impurities came from the ventral missingcorner-exposed-medieval Holland cloth (see location #1 in Figure 11) and not the main Shroud, argues strongly against Nitowski’s assumption that the debris was from burial spices. Based on the Quad-Mosaic data and Rogers’ findings it is far more plausible that the 1FH impurities were also red Madder and Gum Arabic as chemically-verified by Rogers in multiple adjacent samples." 
4.  "Felipe Montero, an expert in working with electron microscopes, has found residues of what is most probably aloes and myrrh on the Sudarium." [here](https://www.reviewofreligions.org/11770/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-and-the-shroud-of-turin/)
5.  Others found aloe and myrrh on the shroud:  [here](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi13part3.pdf)
6.  But this article mentions aloe:  "Experts in recent decades have identified traces of blood, serum, myrrh, aloes and soil typical of Jerusalem on the shroud."  https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/13/highereducation.research

##### Me:

Some Christians who believe the bible is inerrant say that the shroud cannot be the from Christ because it contains no spices.  Yet John 19:40 says Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus "took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews."

Real life is messy. It's common for accounts to tell only a piece of the story in a way that can at first appear contradictory. Perhaps in the rush to bury Jesus, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea both brought a full body shroud, the strips, a face cloth, and even additional cloths. Maybe in this hurried shuffle, the spices arrived after Jesus was wrapped, never touched the shroud or the body of Jesus, and were only wrapped with the body in additional outer cloths.  The women were present at the burial (Mt 27:61, Mk 15:47, Lk23:55) but then left to go and prepare spices (Lk 23:56), and also bought and anointed him with spices only AFTER the Sabbath (Mk 16:1), indicating the burial rites had not yet been completed.  If the men had already applied spices to the body, why did it need to be done again?  This is speculation, but no less than what inerrantists do to correctly resolve other alleged contradictions in the gospels. E.g. "One blind man or two?" or whether Judas died by hanging or his belly spilling open.

Or perhaps the spices were never opened?  But John 19:40 says “So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.”

##### Verses:

I need to include all verses that mention the spices.

Mark 15:45-47

> When Pilate was informed by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. **46** After Joseph bought a linen cloth and took down the body, he wrapped it in the linen and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone across the entrance of the tomb. **47** Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was placed.

Mark 16:1

> When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought aromatic spices so that they might go and anoint him. 

Luke 23:52-56 

> He [Joseph of Arimathea] went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. **53** Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock, where no one had yet been buried. **54** It was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning. **55** The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. **56** Then they returned and prepared aromatic spices and perfumes.

John 19

##### More:

The cloth was clean and wrapped Jesus before he was taken to the tomb:  Mt 27:59:  "Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a **clean linen cloth**, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock."

75 lbs is too much to easily bind with a body.  Perhaps some of it was rubbed on the walls?

The wrapping itself was a common practice:

> Act 5:5 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. 6Then some young men came forward, **wrapped** up his body, and carried him out and **buried** him.



## Dating the Shroud

TODO: Lots from Marino's 2017 youtube talks.  And 26:10 quote from archaeologist Eugenia Nitowski.



### Unauthorized 1982 carbon test

1. A thread from the Raes sample was C14 dated in 1982. One end date to 200AD and the other end (containing starch) dated to 1000AD. (Ant 154 bottom).
2. The facility that dated this thread wasn't a lab that regularly did C14 dating. (Ant 154 bottom)
3. "Years later, Rossman and the California Institute of Technology officially and vigorously denied any such test was ever performed and stated the facility did not have the technology necessary to perform such testing." (Oxley 2011)
4. TODO:  https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/28/did-a-single-thread-get-tested-in-1982-is-it-important-to-know-and-why/
5. Marino 2002 has the most citable details.
6. Guy Williams says he was there and describes the process:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCG4uQRZcA

### 1988 Carbon 14

> Christopher Ramsey, head of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit:
> "As yet there is no direct evidence for this - or indeed any direct evidence to suggest the original radiocarbon dates are not accurate. There is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the Shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed. It is important that we continue to test the accuracy of the original radiocarbon tests as we are already doing. It is equally important that experts assess and reinterpret some of the other evidence."



#### Contaminants

This is separate from residues above as they were not likely original.

Outside of threads coated, 20x aluminum, alizarin dye and red lakes, gum not used before 1291. 

##### Wax

1.  ~~There's a pattern of burn holes in the shroud, perhaps from incense burning during a religious ceremony. Wax would be a useful way to treat these burn holes, as it would keep the cloth from fraying and usually not be visible to the naked eye. Wax would survive the pretreatment process applied prior to the 1988 Carbon 14 dating. (Ant 154 middle)~~

##### Starch

1.  ~~Starch could chemically bind to cellulose, not be detected with the naked eye, and not be removed by the standard C14 pretreatment process. (Ant 154 bottom, but no source.)~~

##### Other Contaminants

1.  ~~There's enough greasy dirt to throw off the C14 date.(Flury-Lemberg 2007)~~

##### Other Evidence

1.  Quad mosaic and front side of the backing cloth is dark green in the quad mosaic, different than the back side of the backing cloth and the rest of the Shroud. (Marino 2008)

    1.  But what about [colors at other corners](http://i.imgur.com/Mxfe7kS.png) of the quad mosaic?  Perhaps they are also repairs as described by Umberto?
    2.  Hugh Farey [says](https://shroud.com/pdfs/n78part9.pdf) "The colour is fairly obviously much more to do with the light source than it has to do with the material of the Shroud."  But Thibault Heimburger [says](https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/#comment-125081) "You have to consider only the portions of the Shroud that were uniformly illuminated: the lower parts. The upper parts of the Shroud (in your paper) in which you see blue colors must be eliminated for comparison because the conditions of the illumination of those parts were likely not the same as those of lower parts."
2.  The Quad mosaic, white light photographs, and UV fluorescence photography all show the C14 sample area in a different color. "This is further convincing, supportive, scientific evidence that this area is inherently different in composition than the rest of the Shroud" (Schwortz, 2011)
3.  There's an "inverse linear relationship between the [C14] date measured and the distance from the sample to the edge of the cloth... with the higher levels of C14 measured at increasing distance from the edge of the Shroud linen." (Marino 2000).  This fit's Antonacci's hypothesis but is opposite the repair hypothesis.
4.  TODO: 2015 paper about encrustation:  https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/09/important-new-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-samples/

##### Con

1.  Freer-Waters and Jull said, "We find no evidence to support the contention that the 14C samples actually used for measurements are dyed, treated, or otherwise manipulated."

    1.  Jull states his sample came from fragment A1B. A1 is above the Raes sample and at the top of the radiocarbon sample area. (Jull 2010, Rinaldi 2010) While Rogers says his samples were from the Raes fragment and "from the center of the radiocarbon sample." (Rogers, 2005)
    2.  Radiocarbon date increases with each C14 dated sample. If Arizona used the small strip and large strip, that would put their date consistent with the other labs, but explain why Jull's was the least contaminated.
    3.  ~~Only did 320x magnification and no chemical analysis and left some fibers unidentified. Rogers did 800x magnification and chemical analysis.~~
    4.  ~~Rogers reported the cotton was woven inside linen threads.  Perhaps Jull missed it because of this and his lesser magnification and unidentified fibers?~~
    5.  ~~Jull's sample is 250 microns thick while other samples average 390 microns.~~
    6.  ~~Confused warp/weft.~~
    7.  ~~Jull is now the editor of Radicarbon, the same journal where he published his paper.~~
    8.  ~~Since Jull was among the original members of the radiocarbon team, does he have a vested interest in defending their work?~~
    9.  ~~Jull didn't respond to Barrie Schwortz's emails asking to photograph his sample (Schwortz, 2014)~~
    10.  ~~[Journal RadioCarbon Stacked the deck](https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/31/colin-berry-on-rogers-thermochimica-acta-paper/#comment-75556) hostile reviewers for Joe Marino.~~

Mark Antonacci says the ideas of bacteria adding C14 to the Shroud (bioplastic coating hypothesis) and the fire of 1532 adding C14 have been easily refuted. (Ant 160-161).

#### Repair Hypothesis

I should make a table with what each side has to say about each evidence.

##### Pro

TODO: A lot more material in [Joe Marino's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu4jibxLD4E&list=PLNXqdetrAZYxTFDcR8h1NFfhBLQq3Rrzp&index=37) at the 2017 Shroud conference.

Evidence of contaminants above. Side seam has significantly heavier weft threads, but the C14 sample weighed twice as much as expected. Three blind-test textile experts noticed a difference in the weaves. Modern weavers can create truly invisible weaves.

1.  Cotton fibers were in the Radiocarbon sample:

    1.  The technician who cut the 1988 samples and a textile expert present reported they tried to trim out "the pollution of the cloth itself with threads of a different nature which even in small amounts could have lead to variations in dating, being a later addition." (Marino, 2000, Marinelli 2012) **TODO:** find Marino 2000's original sources for the quotes from Riggi and Tessiore.

    2.  ~~The radiocarbon team at Oxford also reported finding "two or three" cotton fibers in the shroud (Rogue fibers, 1988)~~

    3.  Several researchers who later studied the 1988 samples found foreign
        material mixed with them. E.g. cotton and foreign threads. Marino's
        paper has quotes and details. (Marino 2000)

    4.  ~~Robert Villarreal in 2008: "The results of the FTIR analysis on all
        three threads taken from the Raes sampling area (adjacent to the C-14
        sampling corner) led to identification of the fibers as cotton and
        definitely not linen (flax)."~~

    5.  The Zurich lab noted "an odd assortment of debris, from fungi to bits of
        nylon" and in Tucson a thread of red silk and blue fibers were found on
        the sample (Marinelli 2012)

    6.  Did Oxford discover the cotton after the other two labs had dated, and
        keep it in the sample to get a match? Speculation here:
        https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/04/what-did-christopher-ramsey-know/

    7.  ~~Multiple experts found no cotton fibers on other parts of the Shroud.
        (Schwortz, 2014)~~
2.  The reserve sample (taken directly below the C14 sample, adjacent to Raes)
    intersects a watermark stain on the main shroud, but "does not show any
    evidence of a water stain marking" which "could very well be explained by
    the later addition of a patch in this area" (Benford 2008)
3.  The Duchess of Savoy, Margaret of Austria, stated in her will to leave a
    portion of the Shroud to her church. She died in 1531 (one year before 1532
    fire). (Marino 2000) The shroud is missing a "5½ inch x 3½ inch section of
    cloth adjacent to the C-14 sample."
4.  
5.  Marino suggested that reinforcement with 16th century material occurred at
    that corner. (Marino 2000)
6.  ~~The Savoy archives record that the edges of the cloth were repaired with an invisible reweave.  ([Marino's 2017 talk at 3:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu4jibxLD4E&list=PLNXqdetrAZYxTFDcR8h1NFfhBLQq3Rrzp&index=37))~~
7.  The C14 material "weighed about twice as much as expected," which could be
    explained by contaminants or reweaving. (Marino 2000) But the side seam weft
    (horizontal) threads are "significantly heavier" than those in the Raes
    sample which suggests reweaving. (Raes 1991)
8.  Three linen experts, in a blinded analysis, were given photos of the area
    where the 1988 material was taken. All three remarked that it looked like it
    was patched. (Marino 2000)
9.  "medieval European weavers would typically try to match the original cloth
    and then hand-stitch approximately ½ inch of new material into the old, such
    that it was invisible to all but the trained eye... This type of detail to
    repairs would be consistent with the wealth and devotion of the Savoy
    family, who owned the Shroud at the time." (Marino 2000)
10.  [Online speculation](https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/):
     "it is quite possible that it was actually done as late as 1868 when
     Princess Clotilde replaced the backing silk lining. That would certainly
     skew the C14 tests."
     1.  But would the reweave have to happen before the 1534 fire? After that
         fire there were highly visible patches sewn in. Less reason to be
         discreet unless a piece was stolen. (Thibault Heimburge, 2013)
11.  Modern weavers at withoutatrace.com advertise being able to do completely
     invisible french weaving and inweaving. Although their homepage shows
     someone wearing a special headset.
12.  Rogers found vanillin in the Raes threads and Holland backing cloth but not
     the Shroud. (Rogers 2005) Adler reproduced this (Thibault Heimburger 2014)
13.  Rogers was very confident: "Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry results from the sample area coupled with microscopic and microchemical observations prove that the radiocarbon sample was not part of the original cloth of the Shroud of Turin. The radiocarbon date was thus not valid for determining the true age of the shroud." (Rogers 2005)
14.  Ray Rogers doesn't show signs of bias.

     1.  Rogers did his study in order to disprove Marino 2000, but ended up
         proving them. [Nature's chief editor Philip Ball](https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/):
         "Rogers thought that he would be able to ‘disprove [the] theory in five
         minutes."

     2.  [Rogers](https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/):  "I accepted the radiocarbon results, and I believed that the "invisible
         reweave" claim was highly improbable. I used my samples to test it. One
         of the greatest embarrassments a scientist can face is to have to agree
         with the lunatic fringe."

     3.  Rogers was head chemist on STURP.  STURP critic Harry Gove said Rogers was "one of the few scientists in that organization for whom I had real respect."
     
4.  "Ray [Rogers] repeatedly asserted to me that he was not concerned whether the Shroud was or was not the burial shroud of Jesus, but if a determination was to be made, it must be scientifically correct." (Villarreal 2008)
         
     5.  Rogers was a materialist (Guy 3) and wasn't religious at all (Guy 4
         35:45). "I don't believe in miracles--no way." [6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOan5hrFMhw). He wrote a book and a paper arguing the Shroud covered Jesus, but posthumous decay products created the image.
15.  "the fluorescence correlates almost perfectly with the carbon dates" [Schneider](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlschneiderpaper.pdf)
     1.  See figures 10 and 12 from [Morgan's paper](https://academicjournals.org/article/article1380798975_Morgan.pdf).
16.  ~~Microscopist John L. Brown also found cotton fibers in Raes threads. (Brown,
     2005 see images)~~
17.  A spliced thread was found in the Raes sample. (Cline 2008) But is this
     image actually a splice?  Rogers also reports finding a splice:  "I do, however, see an end-to-end splice that was very obscure among the Raes threads.  We have not seen any similar feature anywhere else in the Shroud." (Maloney 2014, appendix I, page 2)
18.  Threads in the main body don't use end to end splicing:  " During weaving of the shroud, when a new length of thread was introduced to the loom, the weavers had simply laid it in next to the previous length rather than splicing." (Maloney 2014, appendix II)

![](maloney-2008-splice.png)

##### Con

1.  Patching the cloth with new horizontal and vertical threads could only be
    done invisibly on the front, not the back. (Flury-Lemberg 2007)
    1.  If the vertical (warp) threads are preserved, cloth can be invisibly
        repaired on both sides. But this can only be done with the course
        threads of something like a tapestry. Fine fabric doesn't allow hiding
        extra threads.(Flury-Lemberg 2007)

    2.  Any repair made with the naked eye would be visible to the naked eye.
        (Flury-Lemberg 2007) But Marino 2000 quotes three textile experts who
        say it's visibly different in blind tests.
2.  The Shroud has 8 other sets of patches sewn into repair it, but all of those
    repairs are clearly visible to the naked eye. (Ant 170, bottom) Includes
    picture.
3.  The radiocarbon area was inspected when the backing cloth was removed in
    2002, but all the inspectors confirmed that the Shroud had not been patched
    or repaired at that site (Ant 171, bottom).

    1.  Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti (participated in 2002 examination) said,
        "The truth is that there is no patch and no darn... there are no added
        threads." (Ant 185 bottom)
    1.  But Antonacci's source is a translation of an email I can't check!
4.  "No historical examples exist from the 16th century or any previous century
    where woven linen has fooled close inspection by scores of experts,
    photographs in all wavelengths and photomicroscopy" (Ant 173, top). 
    1.  But Benford and Marino (2000) cite cases where experts DID find these things.
5.  The quad mosaic (infrared) images show a discoloration at the radiocarbon
    corner, but without a clear outline expected from a repair. This is likely
    due to greasy dirt on that corner, not having its origins in rewoven yarn.
    (Flury-Lemberg 2007). But a reweave would show a gradient discoloration.
6.  X-ray fluorescent analysis on thirteen threads from the Raes sample
    indicated they had roughly the same relative concentrations of calcium,
    strontium and iron found on the rest of the shroud." (Ant 173, bottom)
1.  "Under UV fluorescence, the fibers fluoresce uniformly and do not show
        any indication of an overall coating." (Jull 2010)
7.  "Alternating high- and low-density bands [in radiographs] attributed to the Shroud's
    horizontal weave (weft) are continuous through this area and the side seam."
    (Ant 174 bottom).  
    1.  But he quotes his source as saying this could be due to the backing cloth. 
    2.  I couldn't find anything substantive from this.
    3.  Marino 2000 identifies a band that stops at the proposed repair region.
8.  Rogers thought there was pentosan [plant gum](#plant-gum) because there was
    furfural [clear organic compound from plants]. Scorching linen can also
    release furfural. (Ant 176, top)
1.  But Rogers said: "the gum coating on the Raes and radiocarbon samples is
        a pentosan [a plant gum]. None can be detected on any fibers from the
        main part of the shroud." Even though there are scorch marks all over
        the Shroud.
9.  Rogers radiocarbon samples were on the edge of a water stain, where debris
    from water will accumulate. (Ant 176, bottom) Rogers's sample being in the
    middle of a water stain also precludes it from being a reweave.
    1.  But Benford 2008 figure 15 shows the C14 region was entirely outside of
        the water stain!
10.  "Rogers' samples from the radiocarbon site were in the midst of a scorch
     mark." (Ant 175, middle)
     1.  But Rogers 2002 describes scorched fibers as easily recognizable: "a
         scorched fiber is colored through its entire diameter, and the medulla
         [innermost part] usually appears to be darker than the mass of the fiber
         as a result of reactions at its surface and its shorter radius of
         curvature" (Rogers 2002)

     2.  Rogers's sample being next to a scorch mark explains the lack of
         vanillin. (Ant 180) But Rogers tested for vanillin all over the shroud
         from the "sampling tape’s adhesive!": "No samples from any location on
         the shroud gave the vanillin test" yet "the Raes threads, the Holland
         cloth, and all other medieval linens gave the test for vanillin" (Rogers
11.  Vanillin loss increases exponentially with temperature. Being at 200 C
     (392F) For 6.4 seconds would cause the cloth to lose 95% of its
     vanillin.(Ant 180, bottom) (But this contradicts Roger's graph)

### Linen Dating

1.  Mark Antonacci doesn't know of any criticism of Fanti's work, apart from two
    labs that questioned whether their samples really came from the Shroud. (Ant
    159 top mid src 16)
    

## Dating the Shroud (Older)

### Carbon 14

Wikipedia: "In March 2013 Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal
measurement at the University of Padua conducted a battery of experiments on
various threads that he believes were cut from the shroud during the 1988
Carbon-14 dating, and concluded that they dated from 300 B.C. to 400 A.D.,
potentially placing the Shroud within the lifetime of Jesus of
Nazareth.[53][54][55][56][57][58][59] Because of the manner in which Fanti
obtained the shroud fibers, many are dubious about his findings. The shroud’s
official custodian, Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia of Turin, told Vatican Insider:
“As there is no degree of safety on the authenticity of the materials on which
these experiments were carried out [on] the shroud cloth, the shroud’s
custodians cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged
experiments.”[60][61] Barrie Schwortz, a member of the original STURP
investigation team, commented on Fanti’s theory: “But it would be more
convincing if the basic research had first been presented in a professional,
peer-reviewed journal. If you’re using old techniques in new ways, then you need
to submit your approach to other scientists.”[60]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin

Victor Torley: "In the interests of fairness, I should point out that the
authors of the 2017 PLOS One study have addressed Archbishop Nosiglia’s
criticism by obtaining a sample of the Shroud directly from Barrie Schwortz, for
their latest testing, as they note in their Acknowledgments: “Shroud of Turin
Education and Research Association Inc. (STERA Inc.), represented by B.
Schwortz, is acknowledged for providing the sticky tape containing the fiber of
the Turin Shroud.”

#### Against repair hypothesis

### Vanillin loss from Lignin

"It has been stated that Roger’s vanillin-dating process is untested, and the
validity thereof is suspect, as the deterioration of vanillin is heavily
influenced by the temperature of its environment – heat strips away vanillin
rapidly, and the shroud has been subjected to temperatures high enough to melt
silver and scorch the cloth.[46]"

Rogers provides a formula for estimating rates of Vanillin loss from Lignin
here: http://www.shroud.it/ROGERS-3.PDF ctrl+f "Arrhenius expression"

"If the shroud had been stored at a constant 25 ◦C, it would have taken about
1319 years to lose a conservative 95% of its vanillin. At 23 ◦C, it would have
taken about 1845 years. At 20 ◦C, it would take about 3095 years. If the shroud
had been produced between a.d. 1260 and 1390, as indicated by the radiocarbon
analyses, lignin should be easy to detect. A linen produced in a.d. 1260 would
have retained about 37% of its vanillin in 1978. The fire of 1532 could not have
greatly affected the vanillin content of lignin in all parts of the shroud
equally. The thermal conductivity of linen is very low, 2.1 × 10−4 cal cm−1 s−1
◦C−1; therefore, the unscorched parts of the folded cloth could not have become
very hot. The temperature gradient through the cloth in the reliquary should
have been very steep, and the cloth’s center would not have heated at all in the
time available. The rapid change in color from black to white at the margins of
the scorches illustrates this fact. Any heating at the time of the fire would
decrease the amount of vanillin in the lignin as a function of the temperature
and time heated; however, different amounts of vanillin would have been lost in
different areas. No samples from any location on the shroud gave the vanillin
test. Because the shroud and other very old linens do not give the vanillin
test, the cloth must be quite old. It is thus very unlikely that the linen was
produced during medieval times." http://www.shroud.it/ROGERS-3.PDF

#### Fire was not hot enough to affect much

Rogers later elaborated that most of the Shroud could not have been very hot during the fire:
"Remember there are blood spots all over the cloth, and sulfoproteins evolve H2S at low temperatures and they evolve hydroxyproline through roughly the same temperature ranges. Only blood spots near the scorches showed degradation. Your figure 3 shows a t/T curve. The same applies to the other compounds on the cloth. For example, pentose impurities on the non-image areas A (or even the hexose ketoses) would have shown degradation within 4 hrs at 100C."

According to Fig 3 in Appendix 3 of Maloney 2014, even at 150C (423K) the Shroud would need to be in the fire for 4 hours hours to have 95% vanillin loss.

TODO: Use Rogers formulas to calculate for 100C.  The graph makes it look like it'd have to be in the fire for several days to have much effect!

### Artifacts

Sudarium meaning a sweat cloth - aka Veil of Verionica, Volto Santo or Holy
Face.

Shroud / Mandylion / Image of Edessa. Also known as the Acheiropoietos, or "not
made by hand"

 

### 30-33 The Death and Burial of Jesus

Early sources describe these details of Jesus death and burial that relate to
what can be found on the shroud:

#### Sweating Blood

Hematohidrosis is a rare medical condition where extreme stress can lead to
sweating blood.  Jerajani, H.R. et al. "[Hematohidrosis - A rare clinical phenomenon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2810702/)." Indian J. Dermatol. 2009.

-   Luke 22:44, "In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became
    like great drops of blood falling down on the ground." (although this verse
    is not in all ancient texts).

#### Scourging

Pilate ordered Jesus to be flogged:

-   Matthew 27:26, Pilate "released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus,
    he handed him over to be crucified."

-   Mark 15:15, "Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for
    them; and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified."

-   John 19:1, "Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged."

#### Crown of Thorns

Pilate's soldiers forced Jesus to wear crown of thorns:

-   Matthew 27:28, "after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on his
    head."

-   Mark 15:17, "after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on him."

-   John 19:2, "the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head."

#### Beard Plucked

Mentioned in Isaiah but not in the new testament.

#### Nails

-   John 20:24, Thomas said to the other disciples, "Unless I see the mark of
    the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my
    hand in his side, I will not believe."

#### Spear

-   John 19:32-34, "Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and
    of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus
    and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one
    of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water
    came out."

#### Burial Cloth

-   Matthew 27:59-60, "Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen
    cloth and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock"

-   Mark 16:46, "Joseph bought a linen cloth, and taking down the body, wrapped
    it in the linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the
    rock."

-   Luke 23:53, Joseph of Arimathea "took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth,
    and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid."

-   Luke 24:12, "But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down and saw only the strips of linen cloth; then he went home, wondering what had happened."
    
-   John 19:39-40, "Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also
    came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred
    pounds. They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen
    cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews."

-   John 20:3-7, "He [the other disciple] bent over and looked in at the strips
    of linen lying there but did not go in. Then Simon Peter came along behind
    him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,
    as well as the cloth [Latin loanword σουδάριον\* "\*sudarium"] that had been
    wrapped around Jesus’ head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate
    from the linen." The Latin loanword sudarium also occurs in Acts 19:12

 

[Habermas](https://youtu.be/m_uQTXYMUqI?t=8m35s): The gospels describe a half dozen aspects of crucifixion that weren't normally done, and the Shroud also matches these half dozen things. E.g. crown of thorns.

 Linen burial cloth was also mentioned in epistle or gospel to the Hebrews?

### 33-50 AD Shroud brought to Edessa and shown to Abgar V.

In 313-324AD Eusebius of Caesarea mentions Jesus sending Judas called Thomas to heal Abgar V, but here there is no mention of a cloth with the image of Jesus. 
History of the Church
([1.13.5-1.13.20](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250101.htm)).

Wikipedia: "various sources confirm that the Abgar who embraced the Christian faith was Abgar IX." But he was in the late second century, early third century." But perhaps his first century ancestor did also?

Earlier accounts of Abgar's story have been found in Syriac, the same language from which Eusebius's account was translated (Ant 204 src 32 top)

The early accounts say that Thaddaeus (one of the 70 in Luke 10:1) was sent by the disciples into Edessa. Tombs show there was a substantial Jewish community in Edessa at that time (Ant 204 no src).

TODO: Include the account of Abgar from Ant 204-205.

After this there's no record of the Shroud until the sixth century. Pilgrims travelling to Edessa, as well as those living in Edessa, don't mention the Shroud (Ant 206 top)

#### 400AD Doctrine of Addai 13.

The Doctrine of Addai 13 in 400AD mentions a painter creating the image received  by king Abgar: "When Hannan, the keeper of the archives, saw that Jesus spoke thus to him, by virtue of being the king's painter, he took and painted a likeness of Jesus with choice paints, and brought with him to Abgar the king, his master. And when Abgar the king saw the likeness, he received it with great joy, and placed it with great honor in one of his palatial houses."

### Other early accounts

1.  2nd Century Gospel of the Hebrews says Jesus's burial cloth was given to the servant of the high priest.
    
2.  Another account has the garment being acquired by Mary Magdalene (Ant 210, top)
    
3.  St. Nino wrote in the 4th century that most people believed Luke took the
    burial cloth from Pilate's wife and then hid it. (Ant 210, top)

Even though these contradict, they still show mention of the cloth. Although none mention an image on it.

### 4th century paintings that matches the Shroud image

Lady wrote letter to Eusebius asking for an image of Christ, Eusebius said no, without denying he had one.

See Stephen Jones' musings:

http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2016/10/chronology-of-turin-shroud-fourth.html

also this painting:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depiction_of_Jesus#/media/File:Christ_with_beard.jpg



### Silence in forth, fifth, and early sixth centuries

Not mentioned by:

1.  Pilgrim Egeria who visited Edessa in 384 on a tour of Christian holy places,
    and describes each stop in great detail (Ant 206 top, src 36-37)

2.  St Ephraim lived in Edessa in the late 4th century and kept a history of the
    church.

3.  Chronicle of Joshua the Stylite, a monk writing around 507

4.  Jacob of Serug, a very prolific writer in Edessa who died in 521.

### 525? Rediscovery

According to the "Story of the Image of Edessa," the cloth was rediscovered in the sixth century in a space above Edessa's western gate during repairs to the city from a flood. Perhaps the Shroud was hidden during the reign of the pagan king Ma'nu VI to prevent its destruction?

### 544 Evagrius

Evagrius mentioned that the Shroud played a role in the attack on Edessa by Chosroes the Persian in 544. (Ant 207 src 38). Chosros's army worked to build a mound of timber to scale the walls of Edessa, but the Edessans tunneled beneath the mound to set it on fire. When the wood wouldn't burn, they washed the Shroud
with water and sprinkled the water on the wood, and it immediately caught on fire. (Ant 208, top)

After this, many Christian artists came to Edessa to copy the image.

### Sixth Century Depictions of Jesus

Mandylion reappeared in Edessa and the art style changed. Historian Ian Wilson:

>   From the point of view of the tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, there is absolutely no mystery about this. The universally recognized source of the true likeness of Jesus in art was an apparently miraculously imprinted image of Jesus on cloth, the so-called Image of Edessa or Mandylion, so highly venerated that a representation of it is to be found in virtually every Orthodox Church even to this day. (Ant 189 src 4)

(Show images on Antonacci pages 190 and 193)

Christ went from being depicted as short haired and clean shaven to:

1.  having a forked beard with a thin mustache that joins the beard.

2.  A longer and more refined face

3.  Eyes that are more deeply set.

4.  A rigid, front-facing expression.

Anomalies also begin appearing in the images, that match anomalies on the Shroud
but take away from the naturalness of the face and have no other artistic
purpose. As listed by Ian Wilson:

1.  A horizontal streak across the forehead

2.  A three sided square below it.

3.  A V-shape inside the square.

4.  A V-shape just below the square on the bridge on the nose.

5.  Prominent left cheek

6.  Prominent right cheek.

7.  Enlarged left nostril.

8.  A vertical line between the nose and upper lip.

9.  A thick horizontal line below the lower lip.

10. No beard near the mouth

11. Forked beard.

12. A horizontal line across the throat

13. Prominent, owlish eyes

14. Two loose strands of hair falling from the top middle of the forehead. (Ant

Of the portraits he analyzed, Ian Wilson found 8 to 14 of the odd features on
each of them, with an average of 80% of the features appearing on each
portrait.(Ant 192 bottom) A sudden convergence on these (many times irrelevant)
features is hard to explain unless they were modeled after the Shroud.

### 692-945 Depictions of Jesus on Coins

Alan D. Whanger looked at coins and images and found 33 to 100 points of
congruence between images after the sixth century and the Shroud. (Ant 194-195
top)

""

### 944 Shroud / Mandylion arrives in Constantinople

Roman general John Kourkouas brought the Shroud from Edessa to Constantinople,
since Muslims took control of Edessa in 639. The Byzantine army besieged Edessa
just to get the cloth (Ant 197). The emir of Edessa accepted the return of 200
high ranking prisoners, twelve thousand silver crowns, and perpetual immunity
for Edessa in exchange for releasing the cloth. (Ant 197)

After arriving in Constantinople it became known as the Mandylion, and the
sermon, "The Story of the Image of Edessa" was commissioned to tell its story up
to that point. Ant (197)

 

#### Reasons to think the Shroud and Mandylion are the same:

1.  Many in Constantinople were disappointed when seeing the cloth for the first time, because he image was blurry, just like the Shroud. (Ant 198 bottom)
    
2.  Artistic depictions of the Mandylion have it on "a sepia monocrhome to a rust brown monochrome, slightly deeper but otherwise virtually identical to the coloring of the image on the Shroud." (Ant 200 src 19)
    
3.  The Mandylion has the same odd face features mentioned above. Wilson said 13 of the items in his list are seen on images of the Mandylion (Ant 200 no
    src)
    
4.  Writers referred to the Mandylion as a large cloth:

    1.  The word sindon was used, meaning shroud. (Ant 200 src 20-21)

    2.  The original "Latin Abgar legend" presumed the cloth was several yards
        long (Ant 200 src 22)

    3.  Wikipedia: "A 10th-century codex, Codex Vossianus Latinus Q 69 found by
        Gino Zaninotto in the Vatican Library contains an 8th-century account
        saying that an imprint of Christ's whole body was left on a canvas kept
        in a church in Edessa: it quotes a man called Smera in Constantinople:
        "King Abgar received a cloth on which one can see not only a face but
        the whole body"

    4.  In 730, John of Damascus refers to the Image of Edessa as a likeness of
        Jesus on a himation, which is a full length, oblong outer garment that
        Greeks wore over the shoulder down to the feet. (Ant 200 src 23)

    5.  In the last 10th century, Leo the Deacon calls the Image of Edessa a
        peplos, which means a full sized robe.

    6.  The Mandylion is described by some authors as "doubled in four" (Ant 201
        src 26-27) and all but two depictions of the Mandylion (created over
        several centuries) have it drawn as a portrait with a face in a
        landscape orientation. See Ant's picture on p202.

        1.  Max Frei's pollen sampling found more pollen on the face than the
            other areas, and John Jackson found probable fold marks consistent
            with this folding (Ant 202 top) Ian Wilson: "certainly there can no
            longer be claimed to be any absence of fold marks consistent with
            the Image of Edessa/Shroud identification hypothesis."

### 1100s

1.  A document around or before 1130 describing a sermon from Pope Stephen III, in the 8th century: "For the very same mediator between God and men [Christ] that he might in every way satisfy the king [Abgar], stretched his whole body on a cloth, white as snow, on which the glorious image of the Lord's face and length of his whole body was so divinely transformed that it was sufficient for those who could not see the Lord bodily in the flesh, to see the transfiguration made on the cloth." (Ant 214 mid, src 49)
    
2.  From Monk Ordericus Vitalis's history of the church written in in 1130:
    "Abgar reigned as toparch of Edessa. To him the Lord Jesus... a most precious cloth with which he wiped the sweat from his face, and on which shone the Savior's features miraculously reproduced. This displayed to those who gazed on it the likeness and proportions of the body of the Lord." (Ant 214 bottom)
    
3.  From an alleged letter from Christ to King Abgar: "If indeed you desire to
    look bodily upon my face, I send you a cloth on which know that the image
    not only of my face, but of my whole body had been divinely transformed."
    (Ant 214 mid)

While it's absurd to think Jesus impressed his naked crucified body on the cloth
while alive, but this tells us people had knowledge of a full length body cloth
that had the image of Christ.

### 1192-1195 Pray Codex / Hungarian Pray Manuscripts

Either the Shroud image was copied from the Hungarian Pray Code (1192-1195AD)
(if the medieval Shroud C14 date is correct) or the Pray Codex was copied from
the shroud.

![](hungarian-pray-codex.jpg)

Points of agreement between the Shroud and the Hungarian Pray Codex:

1.  Jesus is laying in a shroud-like pose, uncommon for art in that period.
    ([Jones](http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/))

2.  Jesus is completely naked, unique for the 12th century art.
    ([Jones](http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/))

3.  The Shroud is double the body length and is being wrapped over Jesus's head.

4.  Only four fingers visible on each of Jesus's hands.

5.  Red crosses artistically denote blood (citation needed)

6.  The cloth has a herringbone pattern

7.  L shaped burn holes are consistent with burn marks that were already present before the 1532 fire (citation needed)

Other artistic works from this time also began sharing some of these features.  Previously Jesus was depicted wrapped in bands like a mummy (Ant 215 mid)

### 1201 Nicolas Mesarites

Nicolas Mesarites was the overseer of the emperor's relics in the Pharos Chapel of the Boucoleon Palace in Constantinople. He describes the burial cloths among the relics being held there:

>   The burial shrouds of Jesus; these are of linen, an inexpensive fabric, which still smell of myrrh; they are not subject to alteration because they covered the Dead One, clearly nude, and were full of myrrh after the passion. ([English](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi17part4.pdf)\| [Greek](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_hWAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-g_hWAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1))

Although Mesarites also lists the crown of thorns, a crucifixion nail, an iron
flagellum, Jesus's outer garment, the lance which pierced Jesus's side, the
purple garment, a cane Jesus used to break Satan's head and drive him from the
garden of Eden, and a stone cut from Jesus's tomb. Many in the list are
describes as being miraculously preserved. There is of course no way to know
which were authentic.

### 1203-1204 Robert de Clari

Knight Robert de Clari describes his daily visits to Constantinople (modern day
Istanbul) while it was besiege by Marquis Boniface de Monteferrat during the
fourth Crusade. He wrote:

>   And among those other there was another church [lit. another of the
>   churches] which was called My Lady Saint Mary of Blachernae , where there
>   was the SYDOINES in which, [lit. where] Our Lord had been wrapped, which
>   every Friday, raised itself upright, so that one could see the form of our
>   Lord on it [lit. there], and no one, either Greek or French, ever knew what
>   became of this SYNDOINES when the city was taken.
>   ([Dembowski](http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi02part5.pdf))

The Mandylion was also known to have arrived in Constantinople in 944 from
Edessa, and to have been taken in 1204. (Ant 189 src 3)

### 1200s From Constantinople to the Knights Templar

Connections between Constantinople and the Knights Templar

#### Geoffrey Charnay's wife Jeanne de Toucey

Possible path 1: Geoffrey Charnay's first wife was Jeanne de Toucey, who had the
same last name as:

1.  Nargeaude de Toucey was regent of Constantinople from 1216-1219

2.  His son Philippe de Toucey was regent from 1228-1237.

3.  Guillaume de Toucey (Jeanne's uncle) was Canon of the church at Lirey.

Perhaps Charnay obtained the Shroud through these connections. (Ant 225 top)

#### Mary Margaret, the Church of the Archeiropoietas, and the Templars.

Possible path 2: Mary Margaret's first husband was the Byzantine Emperor Isaac
II Angelus.(Ant 225, mid)

After the emperor died, Mary-Margaret married Boniface de Montferrat, who led
the fourth crusades. They later moved to Thessalonica where Mary-Margaret
founded the Church of the Acheiropoietas. Acheiropoietas (that not made by hand)
is another name for the Shroud. (Ant 225, mid)

After Boniface de Montferrat died, Mary-Margaret married Nicholas de Saint-Omer.
He was related to Geoffrey de Saint-Omer who was one of the two founders of the
Knights Templar. Their son William would also become involved with the Knights
Templar. (Ant 225, no src)

#### Rumors of the The Knights Templar possessing the Shroud

As part of their initiation rights, the Templar used "the supreme vision of God
attainable on earth." (Ant 221 mid no src). The image was described as
"terrifying" "bearded male head" "life sized" "painting on a plaque"
"disembodied" "with a grizzled beard like a Templar." (Ant 221-222)

The Templar's treasury was in Acre from 1187-1291, then in Cyprus for a short
time. In 1306 it was moved from Cyprus to Marseilles, then to Paris at a
fortress opposite the Louvre. (Ant 222 bottom)

Rumors began in Europe that the Templars worshiped "an old piece of skin, as
though all embalmed and like polished cloth." and it was "pale and discolored"
(ant 222 bottom)

### 1300s From the Knights Templar to Geoffrey de Charny

Grand Master of the Templar Geoffrey de Charnay was burned at the stake in 1314
under order of the French king Philip IV. Geoffrey de Charnay shared the same
name as Geoffrey de Charny (minus one letter), the man who owned the Shroud when
it was first exhibited in 1355, suggesting a likely relation. (Ant 223 bottom)

The younger Charny was a soldier known for bravely dying while defending the
life of French King John II, in the 1356 battle of Poiters. If Charny acquired
the shroud from Charnay, this may explain his reluctance to share were he got
it.

The Medallion of Lirey depicts the Shroud of Turin, de Charney's shield, and his
wife's coat of arms, which would have predated de Charney's death in 1356. (Ant
226).

### 1355 On Display in Lirey of the Champagne region of France

"For instance, the Templars did not take part in the 1204 siege of Constantinople, and Geoffrey de Charney the Templar lived a hundred years later."  Dominic Selwood.

### 1389 Letter describing fabrication attributed to Bishop Pierre d'Arcis

Pierre d'Arcis was the Bishop of Troyes.

1.  Folio 138 is a heavily edited first draft with violent expressions marked out. It us unsigned, undated, and not addressed to any recipient.
2.  Folio 137 is a neater second draft, which was addressed to a scribe for editing, but is also not dated. ([Fossati](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi08part5.pdf))  It's titled, "The truth about the Cloth of Lirey, which was and is now being exhibited and about which I intend to write to our Lord the Pope in the following manner and as briefly as possible."



"The 2 copies of the d'Arcis letter are neither dated nor signed and are said to
be "of such a faulty style that one could not attribute it to an episcopal pen". [18]"
http://www.debate.org/debates/The-Shroud-of-Turin-Could-be-Authentic/1/

#### Problems:

1.  The Shroud isn't a painting.
2.  Pierre d'Arcis's had a possible motive:  funds were down, and he couldn't repair his cathedral.
3.  d'Arcis doesn't name the artist he says painted the image, nor provides any statement from him.
4.  d'Arcis lists no other evidence to support his claim.
5.  It's written too sloppily to have been written by a bishop.
6.  His letter is not found in the Vatican archives and there's no evidence of an inquiry (Ant 229), suggesting the letter was never sent to the Pope.
7.  Pierre d'Arcis names Bishop Henri de Poitiers as the one who discovered the Shroud fraud in \~1355.  If the Lirey church were involved in a Shroud fraud, it makes no sense that a year later de Poiters would preside at the consecration of the Lirey church, giving it unqualified praise and blessings.

"In mid-1389, Geoffroy II de Charny, having inherited the Shroud, requested permission from the papal legate from Rome, Card. Pierre de Thury, to return the Shroud to the church after its long absence and to resume the expositions for public veneration." This is what prompted pierre d'Arcis to respond? (Fossati)

TODO this peer reviewed source provides details: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi08part5.pdf

 Someone else's Summary: "In 1389, Pierre d'Arcis, the Bishop of Troyes, France,
drafted a memorandum to Pope Clement VII of Avignon stating that the shroud was
a painted forgery. However, there is no historical evidence that draft
memorandum was ever finalized or sent. The account of a confession by a painter
is second hand. Pierre claimed that his predecessor, Bishop Henri de Poitiers,
conducted an inquest in which a painter had confessed to painting the shroud.
The inquest is not in the historical records. The painter is not identified.
Several other documents of the period challenge the veracity of the d'Arcis
Memorandum. The historical conspectus suggests that the memorandum was part of a
squabble about revenues from pilgrims visiting the nearby town of Lirey, where
the shroud was kept, rather than Troyes."

Shroud to her church (Wilson, 1998:67, 287). Margaret died around the beginning
of 1531 (BSTS Newsletter, no. 51, June 2000, pg. 43), at which time her last

Replicating the Image
---------------------

### With Radiation

"A team of researchers from the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), Italy, has found that the Shroud of Turin is not a fake and the body image was formed by a sort of electromagnetic source of energy."

They rubbed a volunteer with acid and covered him with a cloth. Then they aged the cloth rapidly by heating it. This has been criticized here:

 "we know that the blood contacted the shroud before the body “because there’s no image beneath the shroud.”  He added that this image pattern would be difficult to duplicate “because it would ruin the blood stains.”"

Propp explained that while Garlaschelli’s cloth does have some aspects of light and dark to create a three-dimensional perspective, “it’s nowhere near as sophisticated as the shroud” and that “it misses out on the accuracy and subtleties that are in the actual image.”

"most of the blood on the shroud flowed after death. “The side wound and the blood that puddles across the small of the back are post-mortem blood flows,” he said, adding that blood flowing after death “shows a clear separation of blood and serum.”"

### Paint

[Charles Freeman at SkepticalZone](http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/credulous-plos-one-publishes-evidence-for-body-trauma-on-the-turin-shroud-image/comment-page-2/#comment-182468):
"As usually happened with these linens the folding and unfolding led to the
pigments breaking up. In fact , the painted images on the Shroud lasted, so far
as we can see from depictions, up to the nineteenth century. By the time they
had disintegrated the cloth below had become discoloured and this is why you get
such shadowy images. The fifteenth century Zittau Veil in Saxony is another
example with very similar images. Here again the pigments disintegrated ( they
were steamed off in WWII) and the underlying linen was marked in the same way as
the Shroud."

 

McCrone: "The artist had no idea he was painting a negative image although the body image as such... He could think only of covering the body with the cloth and darkening the linen wherever any part of the body touched the cloth. Then, as an artist, he graded the color intensity at the contact areas artistically in
what then approximates a cloth-body distance. The result when photographed, yields a photographic negative... Note, however, that eyebrows, for example, are points of contact and therefore painted dark but when photographed become light and therefore are not a photographic negative. The 'dark' bloodstains and hair he also painted as positive images hence the 'Shroud' is a mixture of positive and negative imagery." (Pg. 190; also 213) 

"But chemical investigation shows that small quantities of iron oxide particles are evenly distributed in both image and non-image areas and that the quantities are too small to form a visible image... See the peer reviewed Canadian Society of Forensic Science Journal, Volume 14 (1981), pp.81-103."



"On the tape-lifted STURP samples (affixed to microscope slides), McCrone found a variety of substances (including mold spores and wax spatters). Major pigments were red ocher (in “body” areas) and vermilion (together with red ocher in the “blood” areas), contained in a collagen tempera binder. He also found the madder,[2](https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/claims-of-invalid-ldquoshroudrdquo-radiocarbon-date-cut-from-whole-cloth/#notes) orpiment, azurite, and yellow ocher pigments, as well as paint fragments, including ultramarine and titanium white—together suggestive of the shroud’s origin in “an artist’s studio” (McCrone 1996, 85, 135)"  https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/claims-of-invalid-ldquoshroudrdquo-radiocarbon-date-cut-from-whole-cloth/

#### Predicted medieval date:  

"It was as long ago as 1980 he predicted that the carbon dating would date the Shroud to the mid fourteenth century, and in 1988 his prediction was proved to be uncannily accurate."  https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8f85/4e169ebd8b68566b89e1a732cd8ff816c49f.pdf

#### Claimed Rinaldi lost faith in the shroud:

"His [Rinaldi's] legacy (to me) gleaned from these last letters is that he was convinced the 'Shroud' is a painting but he held out against all my arguments because of his feeling that 'the simple faith of many good people may be somewhat shaken by this turn of events' and because many in the Church itself still need that assurance in a real Shroud. He knew 'I would understand' as he said in his (October 20, 1988) last letter to me' Now I knew, and was in close touch with, Fr. Peter Rinaldi to the very end of his life in February 1993, which was four years later than his apparently last letter to McCrone. And had he genuinely come to the view that the Shroud is a painting, as McCrone claims, then I have not the slightest doubt that he would have felt impelled to share this both with me and others of like mind. For Fr. Rinaldi to have kept up a sham of continued belief in the Shroud for over four years (not least, after having earlier 'confessed' to McCrone of all people!), is utterly and completely incompatible with everything that myself and others understood of him and his blazing honesty as both man and priest." https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8f85/4e169ebd8b68566b89e1a732cd8ff816c49f.pdf





### "Skin Bacteria created the image"

This doesn't happen on other burial cloths

The image doesn't match what would be created by a cloth wrapping around the
face.

See the BBC Documentary at 15:15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVXXZcN8RVI

No amino acids detected on the image part of the shroud.

Image of the bones on the shroud also?

 

Any body vapors disperse and don't travel in straight lines.

### The image could be created by sun-bleaching

This wouldn't normally create a heightmap unless the artist planned it that way,
and heightmaps weren't invented until the 20th century.

The coloration on the cloth is darkened, not bleached.

### Person ate uranium and died

Giles. guy 4 50:00

x rays cause linen to uv floresce.

even if the body was made of uranium, it would take 100 years to even make a
faint visible scorch. But the body image doesn't show 100 years of decomposition

### The 33AD Jerusalem earthquake

Moved magnetic rocks. Created the image (but this wouldn't create the image on
the back)

Wouldn't only encode near-surface skeletal features on the cloth.

Released neutron radiation that threw off the carbon date (but this would
invalidate all carbon dates)

Features from the outside or inside of the tomb aren't seen on the cloth.

" French biologist Paul Vignon’s vapographic theory (1902) suggested that extensive sweat from the Shroud man produced ammonia vapors which, when mixed with aloes and other embalming substances, stained the cloth with brown images; yet this does not explain how the image only appears on the minuscule top fibrils of the cloth, and it is doubtful that enough ammonia would have been produced to create the intense image seen under a microscope."

### Middle Ages Photography

Nicholas Allen's Theory.

But his reproduction looks like a photo, not a heightmap.

### Colin Barry's image method

https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/

### Misc

 Joe Nickell’s powder rubbing theory (1978) involved pressing wet linen onto a 3-D shape and then after the cloth had dried, red powder was rubbed onto the cloth to make an impression; yet magnified Shroud images show no evidence of staining, and Nickell’s image did not produce a viable 3-D image.62  South African art historian Nicholas Allen’s medieval photographic theory (1995) used a camera obscura method to transfer the image of a corpse to linen, adding silver salts, quartz and ammonia to make the cloth light-sensitive; and his method did produce a better image than other attempts; yet still it utilized an outside light source (which the Shroud image lacks), and no evidence of silver sensitizers were found on the Shroud.63   London journalists and occult researchers Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince’s Renaissance photographic theory (1994) proposed that Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) created a life-sized, proto-photographic image on the Shroud cloth, using a double corpse which had been daubed with blood, and then he added a self-portrait of his own head; yet a drawing of the Shroud in the Hungarian Pray Manuscript (1192–1195) shows that this cloth existed long before Leonardo’s time, and the Shroud head looks nothing like a documented self-portrait head (c. 1512) which Leonardo left behind.64  British physicist and astronomer Alan Mills’ hydrogen peroxide theory (1995) suggested that singlet oxygen (single oxygen molecules) might have left an unexpected image on the Shroud, as had been observed earlier on photosensitive plates; yet this still does not explain the detailed image found on the Shroud negatives, and these ‘currents’ move in all directions, not just upward or outward.65  American biologist Leoncio Garza-Valdes’s bacteria and fungi theory (1998) claimed that the Shroud image was caused by tiny living organisms on the skin which formed a bioplastic coating on the cloth (like neck stains form on a worn shirt); yet no extensive amount of bacteria or fungi was found on the Shroud, nor bioplastic coating.66  [here](http://epistle.us/articles/shroudofturin1.html)

## Common Objections

### Medieval Forgery

Blood marks of the Sudarium match the Shroud, and its history is well documented
going back to the sixth century.

Like 50 other reasons.

### No chain of custody until 1320

"eminent Romans like the Emperor Constantine and Empress Helena were avid
archaeologists with a strong interest in tracking down sacred objects associated
with Christ’s life. Their passion for relics was shared by monarchs for most of
the medieval period, for whom anything touched by Christ was a grade-one relic
to be displayed with the best that money could buy, like Louis IX of France’s
exquisite Sainte Chapelle in Paris, built exclusively to house the crown of
thorns. However, no Roman, Byzantine, or medieval monarch seems to have been
aware of the shroud, and the difficulty with claiming it dates from the first
century AD is that there is no credible evidence for where it was during the
1,320 years following the crucifixion."
https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/04/if-the-turin-shroud-is-the-work-of-a-medieval-artist-its-one-of-the-greatest-artworks-ever-created/



### No Spices found on the Shroud

John 19:39b-40: "Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about
seventy-five pounds. Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the
spices, in strips of linen."

 

### Image from person burned at the stake

https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/17/colin-berry-the-1532-fire-was-no-accident/

### Anatomy Issues

#### Front and Back Images Don't Line Up.

"There is a difference of seven centimetres between the lengths of the two bodies. Then again the heads do not meet, suggesting that this was not a cloth that was ever folded over an actual head. A cloth laid on a body would pick up its contours, but there is no sign of this. Again, the hair of the body would have fallen back if the figure had been lying down but the blood is as if it is trickling down the hair of a standing figure."
https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/

 

But this can be explained if the body is at an incline. And if this were true,
it also discredits the attempts to reproduce the shroud by wrapping a cloth
around a person.

 

#### Face has impossible proportions

"the forehead on the shroud is too small; and that the arms are too long and of
different lengths and that the distance from the eyebrows to the top of the head
is non-representative."
https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/11/29/pope-francis-endorses-the-fake-shroud-of-turin/

 

#### One arm is too long

May have been dislocated, common in crucifixion.

 

#### Bloodflow in wrong directions

https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/new-discoveries-prove-man-on-shroud-of-turin-was-really-crucified

### Biblical Objections.

#### Strips of cloth

I moved the content here to the actual article.

#### Crucified through wrists, not hands

"the gospels of Luke and John specify Christ was crucified through the hands,
which is inconsistent with the shroud."[2] But the Greek word for hand can mean
hand or wrist.

"the man depicted was crucified through the wrists, which flatly contradicts
nearly two thousand years of religious art."[2]  
"there is a growing modern body of opinion that the Romans crucified victims
through a number of places on the body, with nails or rope, and on a variety of
stakes, crosses, and even trees."[2]

Stigmata wounds appear in the palm.

[Habermas](https://youtu.be/m_uQTXYMUqI?t=11m4s): "Philip McNair has studied
hundreds of pieces of medieval crucifixion art. All of them have nail marks in
the palm, not the wrist."

Nail through the hand can't support body weight of a human.

Greek word for "hand" in the NT means both the hand and wrist area.

#### Long hair was a discgrace



How long is long? Nazirite vow.

http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/12/does-long-hair-of-man-on-shroud-of.html

 Stephen E. Jones:

> one of my commentaries on 1 Corinthians points out that, based on the original Greek, what Paul was talking about was not "hair as such" but "*hairdo*":
>
> > "[1 Cor] *14-15* ... Vs. 4 reads: having his head covered, lit. from the head; vs. 6 distinguishes between a not covering of the head and a cutting short of the hair, apparently assuming that even if the head is not covered the hair may still be long. The solution of this question must be sought in the two different words for hair which the Greek uses. [*triches* and *kome*] The first one means hair as such; the second, which is used here, means the hairdo, hair that is neatly held by means of ribbon or lace. That also fits the context which shows that the Corinthian women did not cut their hair short (vs. 6), but that they took it down in ecstasy." (Grosheide, F.W., 1954, "Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians," p.260. My transliteration).
>
> This is confirmed by my Interlinear Greek-English New Testament, which shows that the words translated "a man wears long hair" (lit. "he wears his hair long") is one Greek word κομη (*kome*) (Marshall, A., 1966, "The Interlinear Greek-English New Testament," p.686).
>
> ....
>
>  in [2 Samuel 14:25-26](http://legacy.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+14%3A25-26&version=ESV), King David's son Absalom was *praised* for his *very long* hair:
>
> > "25 Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 26 And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight."

But I don't see support for hair vs hairdo using Strong's.

==TODO== add this to evidence of burial shrouds:  "The rest is now history. This amazing three-level tomb, cut into bedrock, contained in a lower niche or *kokh* the partially preserved skeletal remains of a male with a badly deteriorated cloth burial shroud still visible!"  https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-israel/the-only-ancient-jewish-hair-ever-found/

#### Plucked hair out of beard

Shroud may have some hair missing from the beard. Bible doesn't say they shaved
Jesus or that all the hairs were plucked.

#### Burial cloths were unclean

And therefore nobody would have gone to retrieve Jesus's burial cloth from the
tomb.

#### The Shroud is a graven image

Graven images are made by humans.

### The Shroud shows a different crucified man

But: spear in the side, crown of thorns

abrasions on cross and knees. scourging. no broken legs. pollen from springtime.
limestone from garden tomb.

How would someone else burn an image into a cloth?

Expensive burial cloth.

Expensive burial ointments - [Vatican Insider, 2012](http://www.lastampa.it/2012/05/24/vaticaninsider/pollen-is-evidence-that-the-holy-shroud-is-indeed-a-winding-sheet-XDgioMDXJJtBxfpfjyoSWL/pagina.html):  "'Identifying the main pollen traces found on the Shroud captures a snapshot of a funeral rite that followed the customs of Asia Minor, 2000 years ago. They are the components of the most precious oils and ointments of the time and have extraordinarily remained sealed in the fabric… The correct identification of the Helichrysum’s pollen, wrongly believed to be that of the Gundelia flower, confirms and guarantees that the body wrapped up in the sheet was an important figure.'"

Jewish ethnicity.

 

### Shroud is burial cloth of Jesus, but the image was later faked.

The dehydraged cellulose image occurs beneath the blood marks (Ant 53)

A forger wouldn't know to line up the wounds with the correct arteries and
veins.

How were the anatomical features consistent with rigor mortis produced?

Why no match of any art styles?

Why a heightmap?

If we have Jesus' burial cloth, why was his body never reproduced?

### The Shroud images look very blurry

That's because it's a heightmap. (Show heightmap of terrain or a face and the details created from it)

### Bas Relief

But the wounds line up.

Doesn't create a vertical image.

Lack of detail.

the scorch marks floresce but the shroud image does not.  That shows it's not a scorch.

"When the bas-relief was hot enough to cause the recessed areas to show on linen, the hot spots, like the tip of the nose, burned through the cloth. Considering the heat conductivity of linen - wet or dry - the mechanism did not work."

### Gradual cloth-to-body pressure release

"A ‘pre-mordancing’ in conjunction with ‘body-pressing’ AND gradual
cloth-to-body pressure release."
[Here](https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/17/the-turin-shroud-image-is-not-a-scorch/).

1.  The back of the body would've put far more weight on the cloth, but it's no
    darker than the front.

2.  There's no record of this happening anywhere in history, nor do we have any
    other such cloths.

3.  Why would someone do this to a dead body?

 

### STURP was biased

[Barry Schwortz](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/answering.pdf): "our team included three Jewish members (Al Adler, Don Devan and me), one Mormon, one Evangelical, several Catholics, several Protestants and some avowed atheists and agnostics.  Had religion ever been a criterion for membership, most of the STURP team members would never have agreed to participate. Even the Church custodians and the emissary of King Umberto (the owner of the Shroud in 1978) did nothing to interfere with or influence our work. They did not want it to even appear that that might be the case and consequently gave us complete autonomy"

### Blood is too Red

"The warp of ancient linen was protected with starch during weaving and the finished cloth was washed in Saponaria officinalis suds. Saponaria is hemolytic, which could explain why the old blood stains on the cloth are still red."  ([Rogers 2002](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers2.pdf))

### Walter McCrone

1.  Ray Rogers [says](https://shroudstory.com/2011/09/23/more-on-mccrone/), "Incidentally, I knew Walter since the 1950s and had compared explosives data with him. I was the one who "commissioned" him to look at the samples that I took in Turin, when nobody else would trust him.... Walter lied to me about how he would handle the samples, and he nearly ruined them for additional chemical tests."
    
2.  Response to McCrone's arguments in detail in [this Amazon review](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A224K55EUIDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045UB5W8#R2A224K55EUIDY):
    
3.  Never saw or examined the Shroud itself, only sticky tape samples.

    Author Dan Porter started as a skeptic but now believes the Shroud is probably authentic. Doesn't shy away from skepticism.

Philip Ball in 2008: "It's fair to say that, despite the seemingly definitive tests in 1988, the status of the Shroud of Turin is murkier than ever.  Not least, the nature of the image and how it was fixed on the cloth remain deeply puzzling. " https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat2170
