## The Shroud of Christ

Paul Vignon, 1902
https://archive.org/details/TheShroudOfChrist/

**Matches no known art style:**  Page 85:  "The image of Turin bears the mark of no special epoch. For the art critic, as well as for the man of science, it is simply a direct natural representation. If it had been the work of an artist it would have been more correct — the outlines would have been more exact, the contours better defined. Neck and ears would probably have been added, and the shoulders made clearer. The nostrils, the eyes, and the beard would have been more exactly defined. Nor can we believe that an artist living centuries ago would have been content with those poor meshes of hair clotted with blood and sweat."

Page 107:  "Our examination, then, has brought us to a definite conclusion; a conclusion which we believe that art-critics and men of science cannot fail to arrive at also ; namely, that among all the works of art which the world has ever known, sculpture or painting, the portrait on the Holy Shroud has never been equalled, much less surpassed. It stands quite alone."

**Can't paint negatives:**  Page 108:  "After the exhibition in 1898 many people asserted that the figures on the Holy Shroud could not be paintings, for the simple reason that they appeared as negatives. It was said, with truth, that it would be impossible to paint thus."

**Image proportional to distance:** Page 135:  "In the present case it is indeed hard to determine with what rapidity the unknown action took place between the body and the Shroud ; the main point is that we can assert that the action diminished in proportion as the distance of the body from the Shroud increased. We may almost affirm that the decrease was rapid, as the cloth has evidently not received any impression from certain portions of the face and body, no doubt those from which it was too far distant. Thus it is that before making any detailed examination we are able to assert that the impressions are negatives, because the raised parts of the body are reproduced strongly while the hollows have given fainter impressions in proportion to their distance from the cloth."

I didn't read most of this book.

## The Textile Study of 1973-1974

"The weave used for this fabric does not present any particular characteristics and does not allow a determination of the period of manufacture. In view of these observations, one can say that we have no precise indication permitting us to affirm with certainty that the fabric does not date from the time of Christ. It is, however, equally true that there is nothing that would permit us to state that the manufacture of this fabric was effected in that period."

Although keep in mind Raes likely had half his sample from the original side seam, and half from a repair.

## 1. Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy and Thermographic Investigations of the Shroud of Turin. 1980.

Heller, J.H. and A.D. Adler.  "[Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy and Thermographic Investigations of the Shroud of Turin](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Infrared Accetta Baumgart 1980 OCR.pdf)"  Applied Optics.  1980.

They investigated "Reflectance spectroscopy in the 3- 5- and 8-14-µm bands."  I read the whole paper except for skimming some parts about how their equipment works.  The authors said their results were inconclusive.

## 2. Image Processing of the Shroud of Turin

"Jackson, et al made a detailed study (3) of the three-dimensional nature of the Shroud image. They have reported that the density of the body image on the Shroud appears to be proportional to cloth-body distance at any point."

Nothing noteworthy.

## 3.  Quantitative Phtogrophy of the Shroud of Turin.  1982.

Devan, D. and V. Miller, "[Quantitative Photography of the Shroud of Turin,](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Quantitative Photography Devan Miller 1982 OCRsm.pdf)" IEEE.1982 Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society.  1982.

**History with Secondo Pia:** "Were it not for several perhaps unique visual properties, the Shroud might well have remained in the near total obscurity which characterized its history from the first mention of its existence in the fourteenth century, through the time it was first photographed in 1898 by Secundo Pia, a lawyer by profession and a respected amateur photographer by avocation... What Pia's negatives .revealed was the fact that the Shroud takes on a life-like, well-resolved, subtly shaded photographic "print-like" quality w.hen seen as a photographic negative image... This discovery, in and of itself, elevated the Shroud from relative obscurity to the object of sometimes passionate curiousity and investigation which it has since become. "

**3D Image:**  "the pattern of intensity variations of the image (as measured by densitometric scans of photographic negatives) appears to correlate with the (hypothetical) distance between the elevation contours of a human body and a cloth presumed draped over that body. That such a consistent correlation exists has been qualitatively shown : I.e., the image is most intense when the cloth-body distance is a minimum, and vice-versa. Moreover, the intensity fall-off is roughly consistent with cloth-body distance regardless of where on the image the comparison is made."

**Image is half-tone:** "The apparent visual variations in Shroud image intensity appear not to be due to inherent coloration variation in the discolored thread fibrils themselves, but rather due to variations in the areal density of more-or-less uniformly discolored fibrils. I.e., the apparent macro-scale shading variations observed on the Shroud are, in effect, due to "halftone" properties of the fine-scale image."

**Outer most fibers:** "Photomicrographs (see Figure 4) reveal that the image-forming discoloration is carried by only the outer few fibril layers of the bundles which comprise the linen threads used to weave the cloth. The body-image discoloration is surficial only and does not penetrate into the the threads. Similarly, the discoloration itself is generally restricted to the crowns of the weave and falls off on the side portions of the threads"

**The image is about 1cm in resolution:**  "The image is resolved down to features on the order of one centimeter scale: The crease between the lips is clearly apparent, as are the separations between the fingers."

**Gradual image falloff:**  "Furthermore, densitometric traces across the fingers show a fall-off pattern corresponding to the curvature from the tops to the sides of the fingers, rather than an abrupt ("top only" ) pattern which would perhaps be expected from a simple, cloth/body contact image. 

**The body image doesn't fluoresce:**  "The body image is fluorescence quenching relative to the background (non-imaged) regions of the Shroud."

**Bloodstains are surrounded by halos, don't fluoresce:**  "Fluorescence in "bloodstain" image regions is distinctly quenched. Some of the "bloodstain" images are surrounded by lighter (less quenched) "halos" possibly due to blood serum which retarded the image formation process."

**Scorch regions do fluoresce, discounting "hot statue" idea:**  "Scorch regions do fluoresce, emitting reddish-brown light. Laboratory scorches made in oxygen-depleted conditions fluoresce similarly.  (The fact that the body image does not fluoresce casts some doubt on "hot statue", etc. scorch hypotheses proposed for Shroud image formation." 

## 4. Examination of the Turin Shroud for Image Distortions.  1982

Ercoline, William R. and Robert C. Downs Jr.  "[Examination of the Turin Shroud for Image Distortions](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Examination for Image Distortions Ercoline 1982 OCR.pdf)." IEEE 1982 Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society.  1982.

**Vertical image:**  "The measurements appear to be consistent with a cloth draped over a three dimensional body form.  Furthermore, image features support a vertical mapping process."

"[I]t is apparent that only mapping in a vertical direction produces nearly correct correspondence between points on the body and cloth.  Projections normal [perpendicular] to either the body or cloth surfaces should produce an image with significantly greater distortions.  In fact, projection normal [perpendicular] to the body surface would produce a region of "confusion" between the side of the nose and cheek.  From this simple procedure, it would appear that a vertical mapping from the body to cloth would best explain the type of distortion which might be attributable to cloth-drape. 

It is noteworthy that a vertical mapping would explain several subtle features of the Shroud image.  One characteristic is the lack of side images anywhere on the frontal image.  And second, the apparent "blanking" of the image in the vicinity around the hands would be explained.  In particular the image of the bottom hand at the lower level intersection with the top hand is "blanked out" for about a finger's width.  A simple explanation is that the cloth tucked about the top hand and where the cloth was essentially vertical, no image was transferred even though the cloth was apparently close enough for image formation to occur (i.e. the top and both hands are visible).  If the mapping was normal [perpendicular] to either the body or cloth surfaces, an image should have been formed, but if vertical, no image would have been generated until the cloth "leveled" out over the bottom hand.  Such characteristics are compatible with a vertical mapping/cloth-drape interpretation of image distortions which have been demonstrated above to exist on the shroud image." (page 579, bottom left)

**Experiment:**  "Our experiment began by selecting a group of male subjects (9) whose heights were 5'10" += 2. inches.  This height range was determined by placing subjects of various heights in a cloth model containing an image of the Shroud and determining for what heights correspondence with the image occurred."  (page 576 bottom left)

**Distortions:**  "Though this image appears to be anatomically reasonable, there are some second-order characteristics which indicate that this may not be so:  broadening of the hips, elongation of the arms and fingers, lateral displacement of the hair away from the side of face.  Such distortions have also been noted by other investigators, for example Zugibe, who interprets them as Marfan's Syndrome, a hereditary disorder causing elongation of limbs." (page 576 middle left)

With their 98 models they noticed, "Apparent differences between hip width, arm length, and finger length; all these physical features appear to be abnormal on the shroud."

"It is noteworthy that all measurements falling outside two standard deviations (i.e., hip width, finger length, bottom arms length) are longer than the mean values and that they can be seen by comparing a typical, subject photograph with the Shroud image in Figure 1.  We considered these seven measurements, some of which are several standard deviations from the mean, as definite indications that statistically significant distortions exist in the Shroud image.  These data, however, are probably insufficient to discriminate between various hypothesis which might attempt to explain the distortions." (page 578, top left)

**Explaining the distortions:**  "We are suggesting possible image distortions caused by projecting a three dimensional object onto a curved cloth drape, then observing the cloth flattened onto a two dimensional surface.  In figure 5, we show an image made from projecting a body photograph onto a curved surface modeling a draping cloth over a body.  This surface was generated from biostereometric data of a cloth model of the Shroud draping over a volunteer subject whose undistorted image is also shown in figure 5.  Although somewhat exaggerated, it does point out areas where expected distortions should occur on the Shroud image, if the Shroud covered a human body form when the image formed.  We note that the hips, forearms, and flingers (if they had been extended) would show positive distortion as indicated by the data of Figure 4."  (Page 578, left middle)

"It is important to point out that Figure 5 imagery should be regarded as general indications of where cloth-drape distortions ought to occur and not necessarily an indicator of distortion magnitude... Thus, we feel the interpretation of image distortion on the Shroud due to cloth-drape is reasonable."   (page 578, right middle)

**Face Distortion:**  The face does not appear to be distorted, however, but careful analysis does indicate that geometric distortions probably exist.  At the edges of the face on both sides we note in Figure 6 that the image is sharply truncated.  These regions occur at precisely the place where the herringbone weave pattern of the Shroud changes direction; hence the truncation is probably an artifact of the cloth and not of the image itself.  Further, there is a blood image on the right of the face and forehead level indicating that a supportive structure for this blood could have been present in the region where apparently no image was formed... Comparing this image with Figure 5, shows that the facial image on the Shroud could be distorted in accordance with the draping characteristics of a cloth over a face.  On the Shroud, the hair seems to hang abnormally off to each side of the face, but what could have happened is that the hair was actually in contact with the sides of the face but displaced away by geometric distortion." (page 578, top right)

**Couldn't measure arm length due to burn marks:**  "Because of damage to the actual image on the Shroud, some had to be estimated.  In particular, the elbow region of the Man of the Shroud's lower forearm has been burned away, thereby hindering accurate measurement of the forearm length.  However, we assumed that the elbow was at the burn mark intersection although it could have been further in.  This assumption was also consistent with where the "blood" flow departs from the forearm, probably indicating where the elbow should be located.  In this way we were generally conservative in our measurements." (page 577, right center)

**Summary:** "1) The shroud image contains significant distortions which cannot be explained by anatomical variation, cloth stretching, or photographic perturbation. 2) These distortions seem to be consistent with those induced by a draping cloth over a full three dimensional body form. 3) If conclusion two is physically valid, then the character of the distortions and some anomalies of the image seem to be best explained by a vertical mapping process."  (page 579, right middle)

## 5. Ultraviolet-visible reflectance and fluorescence spectra of the Shroud of Turin, 1980.

Roger Gilbert, Jr., and Marion M. Gilbert

https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/UV%20Spectra%20Gilbert%20Gilbert%201980%20OCR.pdf

**Describes the Marks of the 1532 Fire:**  "In addition the cloth shows marks resulting from a fire in 1532 A.D. including charred areas, scorched areas of various shades of intensity, and water marks believed to have been left by the successful attempts to quench the burning cloth.  Patches also appear on the front of the cloth placed after the fire to cover holes where it had burnt through. At this same time a new piece of linen was sewn to the back of the cloth to preserve its integrity."

**Current Location of the Shroud:**  "The cloth today resides in a chapel attached to the cathedral of St. John the Baptist, Turin, Italy."

**Blood doesn't fluoresce:** "The bloodstains appear to quench the fluorescence of the underlying cloth but do not appear to be fluorescing themselves"

**About STURP:**  "This work was performed under the auspices of The Shroud of Turin Research Project, Inc. (STURP), a nonprofit organization supported by contributions."

Not much else noteworthy in this paper.

## 6. Blood on the Shroud of Turin, 1980

Heller, John H. and Alan D. Adler.  "[Blood on the Shroud of Turin](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Blood%20On%20The%20Shroud%20Heller%20Adler%201980%20OCR.pdf)."  Applied Optics.  1980.

They studied sticky tape from one of the blood areas, but only had moderate success.

**Wounds match crucifixion:**  "the Shroud image contains areas from the wrists, arms, and feet that correspond to the blood stigmata of a classical crucifixion."

**No high atomic number elements except iron in blood:** "no significant amounts of high atomic number elements except for iron appear on the cloth, and iron appears only in high concentrations in the blood areas" (page 2742 top right)

**300 year old Spanish linen with 12 month old blood:**  "However, these all appeared to be slightly more garnet colored and less brown than· the Shroud fibrils."

**Blood can appear lots of different ways:**  "It there is no specific spectrum for blood per se; what is seen depends on the chemical state of the hemoglobin (e.g., reduced. met-hemoglobin, denatured) and on its state of aggregation (e.g., film, crystal, solution)."

**Hard to confirm it's blood:**  "Thermodynamically the latter fibrils would be expected to show the spectrum or a fully oxidized denatured met-hemoglobin, i.e., a so-called perturbed acid met-hemoglobin.  Although the spectra of the Shroud fibrils are, in fact, indicative of such a spectrum, the high degree of scattering from these solid samples makes the visible band shape features less distinct and does produce peak shifts from the solution spectra (see Fig. 2 for a typical spectrum of one of the Shroud-stained fibrils).  Therefore this identification is much less positive than desired." (page 2743, top)

**But other tests do confirm blood:**  "the spectral data taken in aggregate are positive in confirming the presence of perturbed acid met-hemoglobin specie• on the Shroud." (page 2743, middle)

**They messed up and couldn't do one test:**  "Unfortunately, the sticky ta1pe was severely etched by the formic acid treatment and became optically intractable. Thus we were unable to provide this absolute final confirmation of the identity of the blood area material."  (page 2744, bottom left)

## 7. A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin, 1981


Heller, J.H. and A.D. Adler.  "[A chemical investigation of the Shroud of Turin](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00085030.1981.10756882)."  Canadian Society of Forensic Sciences Journal.  1981.

https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Chemical%20Investigation%20%20Heller%20Adler%201981%20OCR.pdf 

They used a microscope and a spectrometer to study samples taken via 5cm^2^ sticky tape by Ray Rogers from 22 areas of the shroud:   "Of the 22 samples received, 6 were blood image samples, 2 were body image adjacent to blood marks, 2 were body image (only) samples, 3 were water stain/body image samples, 1 was non-image, 4 were water stain/non-image, and, also, 2 scorch. l patch, and 2 backing cloth samples."  (page 84)

**Wounds match crucifixion:**  "The Shroud is a linen cloth, bearing the image of what appears to be a crucified man with the classical stigmata of Christ's crucifixion."

"This 4.36 x 1.10 m. linen cloth, now kept as a relic at the Cathedral of St. John in Turin, Italy, has had a long and controversial history, as it is alleged to be the authentic burial shroud of Jesus Christ. It bears both a complete head-to-head, front and back, straw yellow colored 'reversed' image of what appears 10 be a crucified man with 'blood-colored' wounds and scourge marks in accordance with Biblical description in the four Gospels."

**No chemical evidence of pigment, stain or dye:**  "Although iron in several forms is found over the whole cloth its distribution is shown to be accounted for by natural processes rather than as an added pigment. There is no chemical evidence for the application of any pigments, stains, or dyes on the cloth to produce the image found thereon." (abstract)

**Image produced by dehydrated cellulose:**  "The chemical differences between image and non-image areas of the cloth indicate that the image was produced by some dehydrative oxidative process of the cellulose structure of the linen to yield a conjugated carbonyl group as the chromophore." (abstract)

**Describes Chambery fire of 1532:**  "it was kept in a silver box. A fire in 1532 melted portions of this box and molten silver burned its way through the folded c loth leaving scorched areas which were later repaired( J. 7). The fire was extinguished with water which penetrated the holes in the casket. making large water stains on the cloth."

**Disagrees with Walter McCrone:** "A prior investigator( 17-19) has published a microscopic evaluation of the samples from the Shroud. This study claims that the body image is due to an iron oxide earth pigment bound with an age yellowed animal protein binder that had been painted onto t he cloth(l7, I 8). The blood marks are attributed to a mixture of iron oxide pigments and vermillion in this same binder(l9). In light of our chemical findings we disagree with these conclusions." (page 82, left middle)

**Heme, bile pigments, and proteins in the blood:**  "The presence of whole blood was established by detection of heme derivatives, bile pigments, and proteins." (abstract)

**Bile pigments and bilidienes:**  Page 89 bottom left:  "we tested for heme breakdown products, i.e., bile pigments such as bilirubin, with... the commercially available American Monitor "525" bilirubin test kit.  [C]haracteristic blue azobilirubin colors could be positively detected in reflected light of the surfaces of the olive colored shards, the orange globs, and, also. weakly on the more orange colored red coated fibrils...  In the previous spectral work.  it was noted that a peak does appear both in the whole cloth reflection studies and in microspectrophotometry of the tape samples at about 450 nm. This is quite typical of bilidienes and similar bile pigment structures, thus further indicating their presence on the Shroud itself in the "blood" image areas by both chemical test and spectroscopy."

**Blood chemistry is consistent with contracted clots leaving behind serum halos:**  "Positive Bromcresol Green tests indicating albumin could be obtained for the larger, deeper yellow orange globs and also for the golden yellow ("serum") coated fibrils. Thus, this indicates that blood constituents other than hemoproteins are present in the blood areas.  Similar albumin positive tests were also found in areas adjacent to the blood, e.g., the lance wound area.  Elsewhere. expressed "serum", apparently due to clot retraction, is noted as might be expected if the wounds truly represent clotted images as proposed by Barbet." (Barbet is source 14 on the Shroud.com list of STURP papers.)

**Blood proteins not found in image areas:**  Page 90, middle right:  "Positive fluorescamine tests were obtained on both the red and golden yellow coated fibrils, on the shards, and on both the orange and brown globs. The fluorescamine tests were definitely negative on all fibrils away from blood areas. This specifically includes yellow (body image) fibrils and the birefringent red particulate coated fibrils (these a.re found primarily in the water stain margins.). Thus, protein is only found associated with "blood" areas and is definitely not present as a "pigment binder" in the body image areas above the nanogram level."

**Enzymes that eat proteins dissolved the blood and serum:**  Page 90, bottom right: "One further direct and specific test was carried out for proteins. namely, the effect of proteolytic enzymes. For these purposes a fresh concentrated mixture of trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and lysozyme in pH 8.4 buffer was employed. Within a half hour this solution completely "'dissolved" the non-birefrigent red paniculate coated fibril coatings, leaving no particulate residues. This further indicates that these particulates are blood and not Fe2O3. impregnated protein binder.  This protease treatment also removes the golden yellow coating from the golden yellow fibrils, corroborating their identification as "'serum" coated fibrils. Interestingly, fibrils freed of their coatings using this technique closely resemble the nonimage fibrils when viewed under phase contrast... Proteases had absolutely no effect on the yellow (body) image or pale yellow non-image fibrils of the Shroud... Further, in our opinion, the totality of these tests does confirm the blood image areas as blood. The question as to whether or not the blood is human blood is best left to future immunologic testing."

**No metal from pigments/dyes:**  Page 91, bottom left:  "While an individual test may be equivocal. the tests taken in combination enable positive identification of the presence of major elements... The uncoated fibrils (non-image, image. and water stain) all give relatively strong positive tests only for Ca and Fe, except for those from the inside of the water stains which give somewhat weaker, though still definite positive reactions. Thus, we find no evidence for any other metallic species on the body image fibrils at a level that would provide color evident to the eye."

**Not painted with inorganic pigments:**  Page 94, middle left:  "The results of these metal tests are in agreement with the general conclusions reached by X-ray fluorescence which found only in Ca, Fe and Sr on the Shroud above truce levels. However, the chemical testing allows us to be much more specific in the assignment of actual structures of the metallic compounds present. These results do not support the hypothesis that the image is painted with inorganic pigments."

**No organic pigments either:**  Page 94 middle right: "With the exception of positive aldehyde and cellulosic carboxyl tests, all other species tested for tested negatively.  Thus we see no evidence for stains or dyes on the body image fibrils at levels that would be evident to the eye."

Page 95 top right:  "The "color" of the yellow body image fibrils is neither altered nor extracted by methanol, ethanol, benzene, toluene, acetone, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, pyridine, ethyl acetate, dimethyl formamide, cyclohexane, ether, morpholine, dioxane, or water.  Further, the color is unaffected by either concentrated HCl, concentrated NH5OH, or 8N KOH."

Page 96 top left:  "Thus the solvent, redox, and acid-base tests are also consistent with the lack or any applied stains or dyes, but are consistent with the chemistry of carbony groups as a chromphore.  These results are like the metal tests, consistent with previously reported spectroscopic studies on the Shroud which also found no evidence for the presence of dyes or stains.  However, again, the chemical studies permit us to be more specific in postulating chromophores, which appear to be integral to the cellulosic structure itself."

**But paint could've been lost over time:** Page 95 middle left:  "It should be noted that although all of the other organic tests are negative.  This does not preclude the possibility that some of these substances may have resided on the cloth in the past and been "lost" over time through oxidation, degradation, etc."

**Not painted:** Page 98, top left:  "What ever the image is due to, it would appear most unlikely that it has been painted as we normally speak of such a process."

Page 99, bottom right:  "We have further shown that the body image, in fact, is not produced by any pigments, stains, or dyes and is specifically not accounted for by "age yellowed" protein. Protein is present only in blood and in the halo area around some blood. The image arises from dehydratively oxidized cellulose and can be accounted for, but a specific mechanism cannot be provided (see below). This conclusion is consistent with previous work (9-16), in particular the microscopic observations, that show there is no evidence of cementation of the body image fibrils to one another, no capillarity or penetration of the color below the lop surface fibrils on the crowns of the fibers of the weave. no evidence of brush marks, etc. "

**They disagree with McCrone's argument that it's a painting:**  Page 99, top left:  "As McCrone's studies demonstrated the presence of protein, iron oxide, and "vermillion" on the sample tapes, he has concluded the Shroud is a painting, the artist employing the protein as a pigment binder to render the body image with iron oxide and the blood marks with a mixture of iron oxide and vermillion. Although we have also identified these same species on the sample tapes, we have drawn the opposite conclusion. To establish the validity of a painting hypothesis it is necessary, but not sufficient, to identify such materials. One must also demonstrate that they are present in sufficient quantities and in such locations as to account for what is seen. Further, it must be shown that their presence cannot be more simply accounted for by other processes. Still, further, one's conclusions must be in accord with other studies; specifically, in this instance, the physical and image analysis investigations."

"he has not further distinguished between body image and blood samples, nor has he recognized that there are in fact three types of iron compounds present. His protein test , i.e., amido black, as we have demonstrated is not specified, nor as sensitive or as selective as the tests we have employed. He has demonstrated the presence of Hg by electron microprobe. "

Page 100, top left:  "In this regard it is interesting to note that the elements other than Hg detected by McCrone's analysis. viz., Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, 0, K, Ca, Fe and Cu, are in fact all found in whole blood. However, it would be o most peculiar mineralogical assemblage that would provide these elements and not the expected iron earth pigment impurities, i.e. Mn, Co, and Ni."

**Blood is from contact with actual wounds, difficult to produce otherwise:**  page 96 bottom left:  "the indication of bile pigments and serum type proteins, i.e. albumin, allows one to form the opinion that it is, in fact, whole blood on the cloth and not just heme protein. Further, the observations that nonheme proteins can be detected in border areas adjacent to blood images supports Barbet's contention that these blood images generally represent cloned blood and not free blood flows. These conclusions are further supported by the UV photographic studies which show "serum" halo effects about the scourge marks and at the margins of blood clots. That such a chemically and anatomically correct representation could have been produced by any means other than direct contact of the cloth with a wounded human body is difficult to conceive. The detail in the scourge-marks as revealed in the fluorescence photography also supports this suggestion of intimate contact."

**Silver is from fire:**  Page 96, right middle: "The presence of several occasional particles of Ag species only in the scorch areas can be readily accounted for. As noted above, the silver casket in which the Shroud was kept at the time of the 1532 fire became hot enough to melt partially(4). In fact, the scorches are attributed to burns from this molten silver falling on the folded cloth, forming the scorch pattern now observed. We can safely assume that these silver artifacts are simply residue from this historically recorded event."

**Mercury is only in one spot, not from paint:**  Page 96, middle right:  "While the detection of "cinnabar" might be construed as evidence of 1he presence of paint pigments, e .g. vermillion, we note that only a single instance of this material has been detected in any of our samples and we therefore consider it incidental. Further, the X-ray fluorescence studies( 15) do not show Hg in the body image areas."

**Paintings touched the shroud:**  Page 96 bottom right:  "It has already been observed that the Shroud has been copied by artists on several occasions. e.g. Reubens and Van Dyke. Therefore, the presence of such occasional 'accidental' artifacts indicating artists pigments( 18) is not unexpected. To conclude that any of 1he images were produced by the application of such pigments, they must be shown to be predominantly present and in the appropriate locations."

Page 99, bottom right:  "We have also seen vermillion (in a "blood" area, though a different sample from that where McCrone identified it). We feel that it is more easily explained as evidence that artists have copied the Shroud (an historically verifiable fact)."

**Mercury doesn't cause the color in the blood:** Page 97, top left:  "This cinnabar panicle was detected in a blood area and more than sufficient evidence has now been presented to establish that these images were formed by real blood and are therefore 001 composed of "vermillion". Our microchemical tests do not reveal Hg 10 be present in these areas generally at levels that could be evident to the eye."

**Iron found in three places:** Page 97, left middle:  "As noted above the chemistry reveals that three types of iron are present: heme bound iron in blood materials. cellulose bound chelated iron found ubiquitously and more or less uniformly over the whole Shroud, and iron oxide particulates mainly. but not exclusively, concentrated in the water stain margins and in some of the scorched areas especially adjacent to blood. "

Page 93 left middle:  "Thus we find three types of iron onthe Shroud: a) a cellulose bound chelated form b) heme bound forms c) iron oxide (Fe2O3) The predominant form is the cellulose bound form. We have been able to identify Fe2O3 primarily in the water stain margins and charred blood areas indicating that it only constitutes a very small percentage of !he total iron forms found on the Shroud."

**Iron doesn't form image:**  Page 99, top right:  "We have shown that the bulk of the iron present on the Shroud is in the cellulosic bound form and shown that it is readily accounted for by a well understood natural process, viz., retting, that the linen of the Shroud must have been subjected to, and that this conclusion is supported by the X-ray data. We find the iron in the blood areas behaves as heme bound iron. We find iron oxide concentrated in the water stain margins and it is not bound there by a protein. We have demonstrated that iron is present in all the old linens we have tested and retting is a reasonable explanation for its occurrence there. Our conclusions are not only self-consistent, but agree with the X-ray and spectroscopic studies which have shown that "iron-oxide" does not correlate with the visually observed image and cannot account for it."

**Calcium, strontium, and unusually pure iron is caused by soaking linen in water:**  Page 97, bottom left.  It's too pure to have come from any known paint.  But soaking linen during the manufacturing process is well attested.

**Image is from dehydrated cellulose:** Page 98, right middle:  "it is seen that the image fibrils are simply more dehydratively oxidized than the non-image fibrils, but less than the scorch fibrils."

**Image from low temperature heat or extremely high temperature at short duration:**  Page 98, bottom right:  "It would appear that some type of conjugated carbonyl structure is the most likely chromophore [part that creates color]. Its R-bands (5-350 nm) would provide a wave length maximum and extinction (80) of the type observed in the UV spectroscopic studies and would also be consistent with the IR observations. This would suggest some type of low temperature heating process or a high temperature of extremely short duration (insufficient to produce carbonization) as a mechanism for production of the image."

**No other historical records of 3D negative shroud-like images:**  Page 100, bottom left:  "Finally, any applied pigment is incapable of rendering all of the image characteristics found on this cloth. It is highly improbable that any 14th century artist would produce a "reversed" image or could encode the degree of three dimensional, computer readable information found in this image and leave no other surviving historical evidence of his evident genius."

**Ray Rogers predicted these results:**  Page 100, top right:  "It is remarkable how closely all these results were predicted by Rogers prior to the actual investigation of the Shroud"

John P. Jackson, et al.  "[Three Dimensional Characteristics of the Shroud Image](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/3D%20Characteristic%20Jackson%20Jumper%201982%20OCR.pdf)."  IEEE 1982 Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society.  1982.

**Common forging techniques fail:**  From the abstract:  "The visible image on the shroud is not the work of an artist in an eye/brain/hand coordination sense, nor does it appear to be the result of direct contact only, diffusion, radiation from a body shape or engraving, dabbing powder on a bas relief, or electrostatic imaging.  The visible image on the Shroud is probably not the result of a hot bas-relief impressed into cloth, but such a mechanism might be able to account for the Shroud image's distance correlation, resolution, and chemical structure; it does not simultaneously account for the image residing on one side of the Shroud, low contrast of the Shroud image, or lateral distortions in the Shroud image consistent with a draping cloth over a body shape."

**They used a linen cloth and a volunteer to measure cloth-body distance:** "we measured cloth-body distance by draping a linen model of the Shroud, hand woven so as to correspond with the herringbone weave and thickness of the Shroud, over a bearded volunteer subject.  Side photographs were made with the cloth in place and then after immediately being removed.  By superimposing these photographs and using contour gadges (taking care not to deform the cloth) we determined cloth body distances."

**VP-8 image is accurate locally but not at large scale:** Page 563, top left:  "This comparison indicated that the VP-8 image modelled relief variations, z, of a human form over small-scale horizontal distances but generally failed to model relationships of vertical relief between image locations separated by large scale distances."

**Image is cloth-body distance:**  Page 561, top left:  "First, the null hypothesis that p^2^ = 0 is excluded by these data with 95% confidence, indicating that some correlation with image shading and cloth-body distance is present in the Shroud image as Vignon suggested."

Page 564, right middle.  After using the distances of a linen cloth draped over a volunteer to adjust, they found that they could reproduce a 3D image from the Shroud image:  "These results demonstrate that image shading on the Shroud correlates with distance between two surfaces, one of which can be interpreted as a body shape and the other as a cloth draping over that body surface... The interpretation that the Shroud covered a body is nevertheless self-consistent in that the 'cloth' surface, calculated so as to bring the VP-8 relief into an anatomically correct body shape, has the correct geometry for a cloth draping over the body shape, which need not necessarily be so.  It is also noteworthy that this self-consistency has been achieved via a single mapping function, I(d), which applies globally over the entire frontal image, thereby providing a certain elegance and simplicity to the interpretation.  We further note that the ability to independently interpret certain lateral two-dimensional distortions in the body image as due to cloth drape gives the above interpretation an additional realism.  Thus we may refer to the Shroud image as having a 'three dimensional characteristic' which means, simply, that image shading can be self-consistently interpreted as being correlated with the distance between a body and an enveloping cloth."

Page 565, top right:  "It is difficult to conceive of an image-producing mechanism which does not, in some way, incorporate body shape data so as to produce an image structure that we see on the Shroud."

**Range of image is 3.7cm:**  Page 561, top left:  "[I]f we assume that the image was produced by the cloth draping over a body shape, which is consistent with the data, then we can estimate teh effective range of discoloration effects on the Shroud.  We define this range as the distance at which the regression line intersects the average cloth background intensity.  According to this definition, we calculate the range to be 3.7cm."

**Police Crime Sketch Artists attempt to create 3D image:** Page 566, top right:  "To address the first question, we conducted a series of experiments with professional artists in an attempt to evaluate how well they could shade an image with distance... We did not require the artists to incorporate cloth-drape effects into their work, nor did we ask them to create images on flexible, absorbent linen cloth.  We also did not require the artists to compose images of the full body, rather only of the face.  For our experiment we secured the assistance of two certified criminal artists...In one set of experiments, we asked the artists to 'freehand' shade an image of a given reference frame... in a second set, we provided the artists with relief data at 15 specific 'anchor' points on the face (i.e., lips, nose, cheeks, etc.)  The artists then constructed an encoder by which they could convert distance information into shading."

Page 567, bottom left:  "These images [created by artists], when compared to the Shroud VP-8 reliefs do not seem particularly convincing and in general have a mask-like quality about them.  Each image possesses relief deformities, particularly in the lip regions.  The VP-8 reliefs of the rigorous compositions [made by artists given 15 anchor points] do not show a significant improvement over the freehand versions which probably indicates that the 'artist mechanism' has a limit as to the precision by which distance information can be transferred."

**Image can't be seen at < 6 feet, thwarting image by paint:**  Page 568, bottom left:  "In Turin, the authors [of this paper] as well as other scientists, were unable to visually discern image patterns on the Shroud (under illumination of photographic lights) at distances closer than about six feet.  Janney explains this phenomenon as due to inhibition effects in the human eye when observing faint images.  We further suggest that critical band masking of the image by the weave of the cloth could also be a factor.  If an artist were to create an image of such a low contrast on cloth with the requirement that shading be correlated with anatomical relief of a human form, it is unclear how this could reasonably be achieved.  The artist could possibly observe the progress of his work from afar, but wouldn't be able to reliably shade the image by hand because the Shroud image cannot be discerned up close.  It is conceivable that the relative contrast of the image was at one time better than what it is at present, thereby allowing an artist greater visual latitude by which to encode distance information.  It would seem, however, that the global nature of the three dimensional correlation of the Shroud image and precision implied by the VP-8 studies would be difficult to reconcile with possible spatial non-uniformities resulting from a shading structure that varies significantly with time."

**Artists can't paint cloth drape effects:**  Page 568, top right:  "We showed above that the Shroud image contains cloth/drape-like effects in the low frequency components of the image while small scale body surface characteristics (i.e., lips, fingers, etc.) reside in the high frequency part.  It is unclear how an artist could achieve such an effect because he would have to, in essence, observe body and cloth surfaces simultaneously in order to transform their relief characteristics into a single shading distribution.  However, lateral distributions in the image due to cloth-drape, would be easier to encode because the cloth would be first draped over a body shape so as to allow blood staining to register body image locations.  However, the artist would have to be fully aware that such distortions must occur because the image is also laterally distorted where the blood marks are not present, for example at the fingers."

Page 569, top left:  "we are skeptical of the artist hypothesis."

**No medieval heightmaps:**  Page 568, bottom right:  "we do point out that, to our knowledge, there is no example in medieval art history where the image of Jesus as painted on cloth (like in Veronica's Veil or Eastern Iconography) is encoded with distance information."

**Direct contact doesn't work:** Page 569, left middle:  "Generally, the images produced in this manner [direct contact] can be expected to have a binary shading distribution; shading of some constant value is recorded where cloth contact occurs leaving the cloth at the background value where it does not.  Such binary characteristics pose a fundamental problem with this type of process in encoding distance information, for such binary behavior does not provide necessary latitude to encode relief variations.  We investigated this mechanism by uniformly covering the same reference face discussed above with printer's ink and placing a cloth over it to receive the image.  Immediately obvious was the lack of contact of the cloth over many locations (for example, side of nose).  Since the Shroud image shows color in these locations, we gently conformed the cloth to make contact... The VP-9 relief is highly distorted, having a plateau-like structure doe to the essentially binary nature of the direct contact process.  These distortions are sufficiently large that we reject the simple direct contact mechanism, described above, as a reasonable explanation for the shroud image."

**Not from gas diffusion:**  They used steam to create an image on a paraffin (waxy hydrocarbon mixture).  Page 570, bottom left.  "Thus, the diffusion process seems capable of encoding body shape and cloth-drape information into image structure, but only in the low frequency part of the Fourier spectrum.  High frequency components, necessary to define facial details are not generated owing to diffusive spreading.  Since this is not the case for the Shroud image, we must reject the diffusion process.

See their figure 19 and how blurry it is.

**Radiation is an unlikely candidate.**  Page 570 bottom left.

**Heated bas-relief:**  Page 571, middle left.  They created their own bas-relief and heated it producing, a very shroud-like image.  See figure 21 on page 572.

"It would seem, therefore, that a bas-relief mechanism is theoretically capable of producing an image structure capable of a three-dimensional interpretation of a full body under a draping cloth, even though a partial relief is used."

Page 572 top left:  "The image has good resolution and exhibits a relief structure similar to, but not quite as good in detail as the Shroud VP-8, and has a slight plateau appearance, like in the direct contact VP-8 image.  We do note, however, that the medallion VP-8 does seem to compare very well.  Thus, we conclude that the bas-relief mechanism might be capable of producing an image that correlates with the cloth-body distance to the degree present in the Shroud image as well as providing an acceptable degree of resolution.  Furthermore, the mechanism is historically credible since bas-reliefs have been produced by sculpturers for centuries.  In addition, this mechanism generates an image with a chemical structure similar to that observed on the Shroud."

**Heated bas-relief problems:** Page 572, middle left:  "This, however, does not mean that the bas-relief mechanism is compatible with all Shroud image characteristics.  There are some major problems which should be pointed out.  First, it is difficult to see how thermal discolorations can be placed by the bas-relief mechanism only on the upper fibrils of the cloth, as on the Shroud.  Regardless of the temperature of the bas-relief, we observed that thermal discoloration on the reverse side of the cloth occurred within several seconds of cloth placement on the hot bas-relief.  For our experiments we used 350 micron thick linen, similar to the Shroud... we may calculate that t^1^ [linen to heated bas-relief contact time] to be on the order of several hundredths of a second, a time which would pose considerable technical difficulties for a hypothetical craftsman trying to make a Shroud image.  Furthermore, even if he could achieve this or perhaps by extending the scorching time somewhat by dampening the cloth, it is unclear why he would feel compelled to place an image on only one side.  For then, he sacrifices the ability to visually follow the progress of the image development by observing discolorations as they appear on the reverse side.  We produced images on wetted linen cloth and found that the time to produce an image was increased up to roughly 30 seconds owing to the fact that water hat to first be vaporized away before fibril scorching could take place.  We succeeded in placing an image on one side of the cloth by this technique but contrast problems, causing the VP-9 Relief to appear more like a direct contact image, were more severe because unscorched fibrils were protected by water.  We also noted that evaporation was somewhat nonuniform leading to noticeable nonuniformities in image discoloration."

**Heated bas-relief requires super-low-height statue:** Page 752, right middle:  "Another difficulty lies in image contrast.  The maximum shading of the Figure 21 medallion and Figure 22-A full size bas relief images was much greater than the Shroud, approaching a deep brown scorch.  This high intensity of shading at contact points was necessary in order for the more distant parts of the bas-relief to record their patterns on the cloth and is the probable reason for the slight plateau effect in the VP-8 relief noted above.  It thus appears as though linen has a thermal response such that exceedingly low bas-reliefs are necessary to produce an image with an overall contrast variation as subtle as on the Shroud.  The construction of such a relief may pose significant technical problems for a hypothetical craftsman; we note that our bas-relief was 1.0 cm thick at the maximum (nose to background) and the medallion relief was considerably lower, on the order of a millimeter.  We also constructed a thicker bas-relief (2.2cm thick) and observed that the contrast problem was more pronounced."

**Low-height statue won't produce cloth-drape effects:**  Page 573, top left:  "A final problem is that the lateral distortions in the Shroud image consistent with a cloth draping over a full body shape, have been observed.  Such effects are not produced by the bas-relief mechanism since the cloth is essentially flat at the time of image generation.  It is conceivable that a craftsman could two dimensionally deform his bas-relief to simulate lateral cloth-drape distortions, but this complicates an otherwise simple mechanism and it is not clear if such a concept would occur to a medieval craftsman."  And why would a craftsman care about that?

**Joe Nickell's Powder technique produces poor image, shows curvature instead of distance because powder aggregates there, and powder falls through to the other side:**  Page 573, bottom left:  Although not strictly an action-at-a-distance hypothesis, another bas-relief based mechanism has been proposed by [Joe] Nickell and involves contouring cloth to the bas-relief and dusting the deformed cloth surface so as to produce an image.  Since the bronze bas-reliefs discussed above were encoded with distance information of the reference face, we used one (with dimensions 23 cm long, 2.2 cm thick (maximum)) as the basis of the experiment.  We conformed, as Nickell indicates, wet linen to the bas-relief so as to make all image features (eyes, lips, etc.) impressed into the cloth.  We then "dabbed" the cloth with fine tempra powder.  The best result was an image shown in Figure 23 where shading essentially correlated with local curvatures of the face (since that is where powder tended to accumulate).  Thus the shaded image seemed to contain more curvature rather than distance information of the face.  In addition, we noted large quantities of powder falling through the cloth weave structure and accumulating on the reverse side.  Accordingly we conclude that this mechanism is unacceptable."

**Heated copper plate with more engraved lines to store height information.  Produces unrecognizeable image:**  Page 573 bottom right:  "The procedure was to photoetch the distance encoded image for the Figure 3B onto a copper plate, thereby simulating the rough surface of an engraving.  The final result was an effective emissivity which depended on a dot pattern such that the dot size varied with image shading, or equivalently distance... Although the degree of etching was correlated with the relief structure of the plaster face, the emission intensity does not seem to preserve this correlation and accordingly neither would the shading structure of any image scorched onto cloth by such a radiant distribution."

Page 574, left middle:  "[A]s the degree of etching  increases so as to correspond with the increasing relief structure of the reference face, a point is reached where enough metal is etched away that it begins to emit more like background, unetched metal.  Thus the correlation of emission with distance can be double-valued depending on the nature of the etched surface.  This behavior could cause major difficulties for a hypothetical craftsman who might wish to utilize such a process to create a Shroud image."

"In addition, we noted that when heating the copper etching to temperatures sufficient to scorch cellulose, black oxide layers quickly and unavoidably developed causing variations in emissivity much larger than those due to etching.  Further, when the hot etching was brought close to the cloth, reaction products from the cloth often formed on the metal, masking the emissivity variations due to etching as viewed by the thermovision system.  When engravings were brought in contact with the filter paper thereby allowing heat conduction rather than thermal radiation to produce an image, the images were poor to the point of being unrecognizable.  For these reasons, along with other difficulties mentioned by Schwalbe and Rogers, we believe the engraving hypothesis can be rejected."

**Electrostatic:**  Page 574, top right:  "As a final hypothesis category, we investigated the suggestion that electrostatic fields, possibly associated with lightning phenomena, caused a coronal breakdown over a body surface whereby energetic electrons are guided by such fields and register thermal-like discolorations on the Shroud... Let us assume that the body was lying horizontal in a vertical electric field and that the cloth merely intercepted the field lines.  To model such a configuration, we coated a 1/4" plastic sheet with electrically conducting Television Tube Koat.  We then attached a metallic profile shape of our reference face to the coated plastic with spray glue.  At some distance above the face, we glued a horizontal metallic strip.  We then applied several volts between the strip (which simulates a uniform electrostatic field) and the facial shape.  The resulting current flows followed the field lines and we observed, as shown in Figure 25, the associated joule heating with the AGA-780 thermovision.  We found that not only is distance a factor in field strength but probably even more important is **local curvature of the body shape since electric field lines tend to accumulate around regions of curvature.**  Such an effect seems to be a potential problem with this type of action-at-a-distance mechanism inasmuch as the Shroud image appears to only contain distance information.  Thus, electrostatic imaging does not appear to be a viable way o fproducing an image like the one on the Shroud."

**Conclusions:** "The visible image on the Shroud is not the work of an artist in an eye/brain/hand coordination sense, nor does it appear to be the result of direct contact only, diffusion, radiation from a body shape or engraving, dabbing powder on a bas relief, or electrostatic imaging."

Comment on an upcoming carbon date.   Page 537, middle right.  "We are well aware of the fact that the date may well not be of first century origin. Keep in mind that even a first century date will not prove authenticity; an incorrect date, on the other hand, will not reverse the suggestion that the cloth enfolded a dead body, but it will swiftly and decisively disprove its claim to being the burial cloth of Jesus."

## 12.  A Comprehensive Examination of the Various Stains and Images on the Shroud of Turin.  1984.

Jumper, Adler, Jackson, Pellicori, Heller, and Drusik

Jumper, E.J. et al.  "[A Comprehensive Examination of the Various Stains and Images on the Shroud of Turin](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Comprehensive%20Exam%20of%20Stains%20Jumper%20et%20al%201984%20OCR.pdf)."  Archaeological Chemistry III, 1984.

**This seems to be a summary of other STURP and earlier studies.**

**Body image from degraded linen, no paint/dye:**  "the body image is made up of yellowed surface fibrils of the linen that are at more advanced stages of degradation than the non-image linen.  The chromophore is a conjugated carbonyl.  No evidence was found in the body image of any added substances that could have contributed to the yellow color of the fibrils that form the image."

"The cause, then, of the yellowing is chemically altered cellulose consisting of structures formed by dehydration, oxidation, and conjugation products of the linen itself.  Heller and Adler have postulated that the most probable chromophores are conjugated carbonyls."

"This conclusion is supported by laboratory simulations using controlled accelerated aging processes that produce the same spectral reflectance curves as the body-only image areas and the background areas on the Shroud. The changes in cellulose known to be the result of aging are the same dehydrative and oxidative processes described above."

"It is important to note that this chemistry is similar to the chemistry that causes the yellowing of linen with age. The fact that we can see the body image tells us that the body image is due to a more advanced decomposition process than the normal aging rate of the background linen itself."

**Real blood:**  In the abstract:  "The blood images on the cloth are made of blood.  The data, taken together, do not support the hypothesis that the images on the Shroud are due to an artist."

**Origin of the Holland Cloth:**  "For the sake of completeness we will also make reference to the patches (labeled C) and the Holland cloth backing cloth, which was attached to the Shroud in 1534 in an attempt to restore structural integrity lost in the 1532 fire."

**Superficial image:**  "With both aided and unaided eye, we find that the densities above background making up the body-only image are composed of groups of these yellow fibrils residing only on the uppermost portions of the threads... Further, with few exceptions, we find that the yellow coloration of the fibrils is interrupted as the thread goes beneath a crossing thread in the weave pattern. Those few exceptions where the yellowing appears to pass under the crossing thread seem due to mechanical stretching of the cloth, because these are usually accompanied by a region of uncolored fibrils at the opposite end of the exposed thread where it comes up from beneath a crossing thread."

**Only on uppermost portion of threads:** " The yellowed fibrils are not yellowed continuously over their entire length. We observed a fibril that was yellow only on the part that was on the uppermost portion of the thread but lost its coloring as it left the upper portion of the thread in its normal course of following the twist to the lower portion of the thread. "

**No paint/dye/coating:** "These groups of [image] fibrils are not cemented to one another as was demonstrated by probing with a dissecting needle. Thus, no pigment "binder" appears to be present... At magnifications of up to 1000 x, these fibrils do not appear to have any coating. This is most clearly demonstrated by observations made at the joint locations of the linen fibrils. These joints exhibit no meniscus, but are clearly and sharply defined with no evidence of a coating.  Further, under phase contrast microscopy, these fibrils not only appear 011coated, but show "corroded" surfaces as would be expected for an oxidatively degraded cellulosic material."

"Finally, microchemical tests (12), mass spectroscopy (16), and laser microprobe Raman spectroscopy (16) all rail to show the presence of any added materials on the yellow body-only image fibrils to within their limits of detection. We conclude that no material bas been added to these yellowed fibrils to produce the color."

**Halftone image:** "we found that the darker portions of the image were not due to a variation of the degree of the yellowing of the fibrils, but rather lo the presence of more yellowed fibrils per unit area. Thus, the extent of yellowing of a given fibril was the same, to within 10% (of full scale) of any other yellowed fibril on the basis of microdensitometric measurements of the color photomicrographs. The shading of the body-only image, then, is much like that of a halftone. In this regard, it should be noted that there are ubiquitous examples of yellowed fibrils lying adjacent to unyellowed fibrils."

**Shading is consistent with cloth-body distance:** "These studies show that a relationship exists between the shading density of the image and expected cloth-body distances obtained by enfolding volunteer human subjects in a full scale model of the Shroud."

**Back image is similar to front image:** "the maximum optical densities of the dorsal image are nearly the same as those for the frontal image. Further, qualitatively, the optical density of the dorsal image falls off from peak density to that of the background over anatomical distances (e.g., in the region of the call) suggesting a similar correlation to cloth-body distance as exists for the frontal image. However, other portions of the dorsal image might be interpreted as characteristic of a contact mechanism (17). A more definitive statement must await further study."

**Under white light, the color of the image is yellow, not sepia:** "In white light, the color of the body-only image is yellow [c.f. spectra (4,6)]. It is interesting that the image has been described prior to the 1978 testing (as a monotonic sepia color; however, the perceptual judgement of color is extremely sensitive to lighting and the distance from the cloth to the observer.  Under low color temperature lighting, it is possible that the color could be mistaken for sepia because the yellow is due to a brood absorption of the blues (shorter wavelengths in the visible spectra)."

**Unlike most paintings, the image looks the same in infrared (IR):** "Accetta and Baumgart viewed the image in the IR both at 3-.5 µm and at 8-14 µm (5). In the 3-5 µm range no discernible image was evidenced. In the 3-5 µm range a clearly discernible emission image was visible. They could find no apparent differences in spatial distribution between the IR and visible image (unlike the case for most paintings)."

**Iron oxide and blood seen under microscope, but do not cause image:** "Al higher magnifications, up to 1000x, two types of"red" particles identified ns either iron oxide or "blood" are occasionally present on some of the yellow fibrils; however, it is clear that these particles do not account for the yellow color of the fibrils or the imago itself' for several reasons.  x-Ray fluorescence analysis of the Shroud shows that there is no correspondence of the body-only image density to the concentration of high-Z elements (particularly note, Fe) within the resolution of the analysis. The spectral characteristics of body-only image are different from those of iron oxide. Further, one would expect that an image of comparable optical density to that of the visual body-only image on the Shroud, if made from iron oxide pigments, would have  appeared on the x-radiographs."

**Walter McCrone failed to distinguish body image and blood fibers:** "That this conclusion is contrary to previously reported results (13-15), seems to arise from a failure of those investigators to discriminate between body-only image and blood image fibrils. They have apparently concluded by visual inspection only that the yellow-appearing fibrils from these two disparate types of locations are identical. Chemical observations do not agree with this assumption. Blood image fibrils do test positive for protein. Further, the "yellow-coated" fibrils found in the blood-image areas are yellowed by a distinctly different cause, that is, serum proteins."

**Walter McCrone used Amido Black, which can't tell the difference between flax fiber and proteins:** "A further possible contribution to the misidentification of protein on fibrils from the body-only image areas (14) is due to the use of only the amido black test as a confirmatory test for protein. Amido black is not a metachromatic stain, that is. Lt does not show a color change on its staining interaction with protein. Amido black, being a basic dye, also stains oxidized cellulose in the same fashion, as is readily demonstrated by its staining rayon (i.e., regenerated cellulose that is completely protein free) (12). Therefore, positive amido black tests without proper controls do not demonstrate the presence of protein as claimed in Reference 14."

**Tape removes more easily from body images areas, suggesting they're more degraded:** "Schwalbe and Rogers note that in removing the tape samples, die tape pulled up more easily from the body-image areas than from the non-image areas. The linen fibrils seen on the body-image tapes are shorter and more fractured than are those from non-image areas. Both of these observations suggest that the body-image fibrils are more chemically degraded than are those from the non-image areas."

**Not dye b/c no absorption in shorter visible wavelengths, not soluble in water or temperature, doesn't fluoresce in UV, no response to solvents, acids, bases, oxidants, or weak reductants.  Chemical tests don't reveal metallic or chromophoric organic groups** "One possible explanation might be an organic stain or dye. The body-only image exhibits broad nonspecific absorption in the shorter visible wavelengths (4,6), unlike many naturally occurring dyes.  Further, many natural dyes are soluble in water and would ha,•e migrated at the time the water marks were made (c.f. below). As Schwalbe and Rogers point out, the body-only images were unaffected by such water. Further, most organic dyes are affected by temperature, and the Shroud body-only images exhibit no color change in areas where scorch marks &om the 1532. fire intersect body-only images. Many organic chromophores are fluorescent in the visible when excited by UV light, and the body-only images are nonfluorescing (IO). " (cites Schwalbe and Rogers, 1982.)  

"the color is not extractable in various organic solvents covering the entire range of solubility classes: the color docs not change on treatment with strong acids and(or) bases; the color was not bleached by weak oxidants (even under UV irradiation), nor by weak reductants: and a wide range of specific metallic elements and chromophoric organic grou1>s were not evidenced by specific chemical tests." (Cites Heller and Adler, 1982)

**Image color not from diffraction:** "We can also rule out the possibility that the yellow color arises from diffraction and/or dichroic phenomena; there is no evident angular dependence for the apparent color, as is required by such mechanisms."

**Image color not from selective scattering:** "Selective scattering by the cellulose structure is also ruled out because the surface structures in both the body-011ly image areas and the background areas are essentially the same. Scattering from both areas is due to the fibrils. but the body-only image areas have enhanced density of "yellow" color over background areas that are pale straw color to the eye. The slightly rougher fibril appearance in the body-only image areas is at a scale size orders of magnitude greater than the wavelengths in question, and therefore does not contribute selectively to the color."

**Color of the blood:  red, crimson, yellow, brown, clear borders:**  "The color of the darker portions of the blood images is quite red. The color is not uniform, however, and the color ranges from a brown through red to orange.  In general. the color has a crimson appearance as would be expected for old blood stains composed of a solid-phase mixture of methemoglobin (brown) and its degradation products !e.g., bilidienes, such as rubins (orange)], both of which have been demonstrated to be present in these blood images. In some areas there is evidence of some apparently colorless fluid borde1ing or diffusing farther out than the darker fluid (one could thus conclude that this fluid would be thinner than the darker fluid, c.f. below)."

**Blood first, before image:** "This absence of body image on the wound image margins suggests that the blood images were present on the cloth before the body image was ''placed," "appeared," or perhaps "developed." This suggestion is consistent with the chemistry of the body-only image, because this thinner fluid could have coated these margin fibrils sealing them and preventing the advanced decomposition reaction. This conclusion is supported by microscopic examination of the fibrils from the blood areas after removing the serum coating by protease digestion."

**Dumbbell shaped scourge marks:** "These appear to be somewhat different from the other two types of blood images. Under UV fluorescence, they appear to be darker than the image and, also, to be much more sharply defined than they appear in visible light [Miller, 1980], as would be expected on the basis of the known spectral characteristics of iron porphyrin compounds [Heller, 1981]. The geometric similarity of groups of these dumbbell-shaped marks is also quite striking [Bucklin, 1980]. Fine 'scratches' from the distal ends of these dumbbell-shaped marks appear in the UV-stimulated fluorescence photographs [Miller, 1980]."

**Consistent with blood applied to other ancient linen:** "Samples of ca. 300-year-old Spanish linen were treated with partially clotted blood and allowed to sit for 18 months (J l,12). Microscopic samples of this treated linen made with sticky tape in the same manner as the Shroud samples appeared to be very similar to the Shroud samples.   Amorphous globs colored orange to orange-red to yellow to yellow-red were observed in the Shroud samples and appeared similar to those from samples taken from such treated linen. ln other words, microscopically the Shroud samples taken from the blood areas looked like blood as seen on a simulacrum (12). "

**Red blood particles found in blood areas:**  "Also present on the Shroud samples was a significantly high number of nonbirefringent red particles identified as blood and decomposed blood.  materials {12} and not as protein "cemented" iron oxide (13- 15). These pa1ticles were ubiquitous in the blood areas. This finding is in distinct contrast to the limited quantity of nonbirefringent and birefringent red particles present in body-only and off-body clear areas on the Shroud. The relative quantities of all such red particles in these off-blood areas were several orders of magnitude less than those in the blood areas. These blood image particles are clearly associated with blood materials and are present only incidentally in other regions of the cloth where they are occasionally observed due to translocation (c.f. background section). "

Iron however is birefringent:  "Birefringent red particles identified as iron oxide are occasionally seen only in these scorch blood areas. Such birefringent red iron oxide particles are only prevalent in the water stain margins (c. f., below). "

**Blood areas test positive for expected blood proteins:**  "The non birefringent, red-coated fibrils test positively for protein with fluorescamine and also positively for serum albumin with bromcresol green indicating that they are blood serum coated (12). 

**Blood is not glued on:**  "Suggestions (14) that this protein coating is a "collagen-type" animal glue used in medieval times as a paint binder are inconsistent with positive selective tests for serum albumin. The identification of the albumin (12) has now been immunocl1cmicalJy confirmed."

**Body image is not created from collagen or other proteins:** "the suggestion that the body-only image was formed by such "yellowed" collagen is also unjustified as no protein can be detected by the fluorescamine and protease tests on such fibrils. Also, Miller and Pellicori found that both laboratory-prepared animal-glue collagen as well as glue used as a binder in a bible (ca. A.D. 1400) fluoresced brightly in the visible range when excited by UV radiation (365 nm); both the Shroud blood images and body-only images were nonfluorescing under the same conditions [Miller, 1981]."

**Is human (or at least primate) blood:** "In dosing this section we can state that the blood image areas appear to be composed of blood. Whether the blood is of human origin we cannot definitively say. However, we have recently confirmed the Italian immunochemical tests [here the authors cite a private communication from Pierluigi Baima Bollone] suggesting that It is, in fact, human blood on the basis of positive tests involving human antiglobulin.  Our tests employed human antialbumin and anti-whole sera. However, the problem of cross-serological interactions of other primate bloods prevents an absolute identification of the blood as human at this time"

"We, therefore, strengthen our statement on the blood to say that all of what we see in the blood area is derivable from blood itself or its products."

**Folding the shroud moved small, dried blood particles to other areas:** "All blood stains appeared to have had the upper portions of the dried stain removed as if abraded by mechanical wear; the most intact stain is seen in the interstices of the weave of the cloth. Repented folding of the cloth has apparently translocated some of this abraded material to other locations."

**Burn marks put an upper limit on the temperature that created body image:** "It should also be noted that the difference in the UV spectra and fluorescenre characteristics between scorch and body--0111)' image noted earlier."

**Only the water marks show up in xrays, because they have heavy elements:**  "The water marks are interesting as they are the only marks (other than added material like the patches) that show up distinctly in the x-radiographs (9). Clearly, the density of heavy elements in the water-mark boundaries is sufficiently great to be apparent 011 these x-radiographs."

This shows that the image isn't made of heavy elements.

**Water didn't affect body image, migrated a little blood:**  "At 50 x magnification there is little that is remarkable other than the observation that neither the body-only images nor blood images migrated."

**Shroud feels less than 600 years old:** "The material feels remarkably supple, considering it is at least six centuries old."

**Uneven threads and weave show it was hand-spun:** "The threads are seen in the x-radiographs to be inhomogeneous and the weave is somewhat uneven, as would he expected of a hand-spun, hand-loomed linen (9)"

**Cites a source saying 3-in-1 herringbone is common in antiquity:**  "The weave of the cloth is seen to be a 3-to-l herringbone twill (7) [supposedly typical of near-Eastern cloths of antiquity (23)]."

**Shroud was left folded at least four times:** "There appear to be at least four distinct fold patterns that are identifiable in the permanent-fold patterns that are on the Shroud."

**Folding explains translocations of particles:** "Jackson performed an experiment in which he deposited ferric oxide in locations corresponding to the blood images 011 the Shroud on a clean piece of cloth of the dimensions of the Shroud. After just four foldings he took sticky tape samples on his laboratory cloth in the same manner as samples made on the Shroud and found that the ferric oxide had migrated to every location where blood debris has been occasionally found on the Shroud. Because, as stated earlier, There is clear evidence that material Is missing from the blood-image areas, the translocation model explains how the occasional blood particles, and other particles as well, could have been relocated to all parts of the cloth including the off-image areas. TI1is translocation mechanism coupled with the water-caused migration at the time of the 1532 fire explains why various "atypical occasional" objects are found in various locations on the Shroud."

**Retting explains iron in shroud linen:** "In the manufacture of linen from flax at that lime, the linen was subjected to a process called retting. Retting involved submerging the linen an extended time in natural bodies of water while it underwent a fermentative process. During retting the linen can act as an ion exchange resin and selectively take up iron and calcium. Subsequently, some of this iron could become converted to ferric oxide in the waterstain margins by a process similar to the production of "mineral khaki." Of possible interest is the finding that we have similar positive tests for calcium and Iron in the 300-year-old Spanish linen, some Coptic funerary linen (ca. A.0, 350), and some Pharaonic funerary linen (ca. 1500 8.c.). Iron oxide particles found on the Shroud arc chemically pure to the level of 99+ %, as would be expected if they were formed by a "khakilike" process from the iron taken up by the original retting. The only other source of Iron on the Shroud is from blood. which Is also pure as of biological origin. In contrast, earth pigments (13-15) such as Venetian red or ocher from medieval or older European, North African, or ~fiddle Eastern sources are always contaminated with elements such as manganese. nickel. or cobalt above the level of l % (unless pure hematite crystals were employed by the artist. which, although possible, is highly unlikely).  Examination of medieval Venetian red and ocher demonstrates that these contaminants are omnipresent above the 1% level. Indeed, electron microprobe of late medieval ferric oxide-derived paints or even modern ones shows such contaminants. ln contrast, electron microprobe analysis of Shroud samples shows uncontaminated iron-with no detectable manganese, nickel, or cobalt."

**Has silver specks from 1532 fire:**  "There are occasional tiny black irregular specks (and one larger one) that are only found in scorch areas. These specks give a positive silver reaction and are undoubtedly due to the molten silver splatter at the time of the 1532 fire (12)."

**No evidence the blood was painted up later to enhance it:** "Finally, there is nothing unaccounted for in the blood areas that would lead one to suspect that anything but blood formed the blood images (12). We therefore do not agree  that there has been an attempt to artistically enhance a "preexisting" blood image (13-15); nor do we feel that these are "painted" blood images"

**Exposure to other art explains slight pigment dust:** "The Shroud is known to have been reproduced by several artists since the 14th century and therefore to have been exposed to pigment "debris." This is sufficim1t explanation for such incidental appearances,  However, the observed concentrations of these materials are not sufficient, by many orders of magnitude, to account for what is observed visually.  AJI observations confirm that the b"

**Blood matches body/wound contact:** "First, the blood images present no mystery; all evidence suggests that the blood went on as one would expect for a cloth in contact with wounds or the normal secretions of such wounds. We therefore suggest that the blood images are the natural consequences of the linen being in contact with wounds.  If the blood images were made by contact with wounds, it follows that the cloth was used to enfold a body. We have independent evidence that the cloth was used in this way. The mapping function, which maps body-only image density to expected cloth-body distance and the two dimensional placement of the image on the cloth, offers a consistent argument that the Shroud enfolded a human-body shape. If we couple this argument with the testimony of the forensic pathologists, we can say more: not only was it a human form, but further, it was a human body."

**Image not from capillary action:** "Because the yellow fibrils comprising the body-only image are confined to the uppermost portions of the threads of the cloth, mechanisms that would evidence migration by capillary action can be excluded."

**Body image from heat:** "The case for the yellow color being due to chemistry similar to that of a light scorch or ambient temperature process goes further, however."

"It is important to note that this chemistry is similar to the chemistry that causes the yellowing of linen with age."

"This yellowing is due to the natural process of dehydration, oxidation, and conjugation typical of low-temperature cellulose decomposition: the chromophore is some form of conjugated carbonyl groups."

"Because the yellow fibrils comprising the body-only image are confined to the uppermost portions of the threads of the cloth, mechanisms that would evidence migration by capillary action can be excluded."

**Not from direct contact:**  "The Shroud's mapping relationship, however, poses the strongest objection to a contact mechanism. Contact mechanisms have not been able to produce a convincing cloth-body distance relationship. In fact, taken alone, this mapping function seems to suggest some kind of a "projection" mechanism, because there seems to be image present even where it docs not appear to have been possible that the cloth was in contact with the body."

**Not from simple molecular diffusion or radiation:** "Simple molecular diffusion and "'radiation" models, for example, fail to account for the apparent resolution of the image as we understand it."

**There's no other cloth with a body image like the shroud:** "We really do not have a satisfactory, simple explanation for how the body image got on the cloth. We think this fact is underscored by the fact that to our knowledge no other image on any cloth--grave cloth or art form--like the body image on the Shroud is known to exist today. If another example were to exist, our task of identifying the origin of the body image would be much simplified."

## 13. Ultraviolet fluorescence photography of the Shroud of Turin.  1981.

Miller, V.D. and S. F. Pellicori.  "[Ultraviolet fluorescence phototography of the Shroud of Turin](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/UV%20Fluorescence%20Miller%20Pellicori%201981%20OCRsm.pdf)."  Journal of Biological Photography.  1981.  
Miller was a scientific photographer and Pellicori a visible/UV spectroscopy expert.  Both were members of STURP who participated directly in the 1978 examination of the shroud.  In this paper they used ultraviolet fluorescence photography to detect organic and inorganic compounds on the shroud.

**STURP team was 32 scientists and assistants, used advanced equipment:**

> The United States team, an independent group of 32 scientists and assistants, was equipped with instrumentation capable of detecting work produced by known artistic techniques and adequate to provide a broadly-based foundation of information.  The instrumentation included x-ray transmission and fluorescence5 to detect high atomic number elements expected for inorganic pigments, microscopy for visual and photographic examination of details, photoelectric spectrophotometry for measurements of reflectance and fluorescence, photography9 through bandpass filters, infrared spectrometry10 and UV fluorescence photography documented here for the first time. 

**Blood and scourges have fluorescing border areas:**

> Blood:  Highly absorbing. No color. Fluorescing borders apparent around some areas. 

> Left foot:  A fluorescing border in the blood now off the body image areas is seen. 

> Dorsal midsection:  There are, some lighter border areas associated with the blood flow.

> Scourges are apparent through the scorched shoulder areas above the patches. Many scourges have fluorescing bordering areas. 

> Notice the clear fluorescing borders around the hand wound blood stains. As is true of scourges elsewhere, the scourge wounds are more distinguishable in the fluorescence photos.

Page 83, middle:

> On the feet, two blood stain areas are distinguishable on the right foot; the smaller one is denser, the larger has a fluorescing border area.

> The blood stains on the dorsal head area are bounded by brighter areas. 

> The blood streaks in the hair are denser on the right side and have fluorescing boundaries. 

From the conclusion:

> Another feature requiring explanation is the lighter bordering area seen with many bloodstained areas. The interpretation is that blood serum is present. It might have acted to retard the image development reactions associated with the body image.

**Some scourge markes seen only in fluorescent light:**

> Some scourge marks appear only in the fluorescence photos: examples are noted between the hands and forearm areas.

**Body image is aged cellulose:**

> These experiments [Here they cite Pellicori, 1980] have led to the interpretation that the body image is the result of locally accelerated dehydration/oxidation and conjugation of the cellulose molecular structure. 

**No paint, pigment, or dye:**

> A quite frequent hypothesis is that the body image was painted. The binders used in paints as early as the 14th century would be made of proteinaceous materials, animal collagen being a favored material; egg white and gelatin are other examples.  But these collagens would inherently be contaminated by fluorescing amino acids.

But on page 77 they say the body image does not fluoresce:

> Body Image:  [Under UV Fluorescence] No color; prevents or absorbs the background fluorescence. 

In agreement with others:

> Microchemical analyses on fibrils retrieved from the Shroud have shown the absence of paints, pigments, stains, dyes and protein in body image areas. [Here they cite Heller and Adler, 1981]

**Blood on the shroud is from body contact:**

> The sharp detail revealed for the first time, particularly in the scourges, suggests that intimate cloth-body contact occurred. 

**Side strip weft bands match up with the rest of the shroud:**

> The 8-cm side strip running the length of the Shroud shows weft bands that are continuous with the main body of the Shroud. Similar appearances result from backlighting and low-energy radiography. The suggestion is that this strip was not separated from the main body over its entire length. Many of these unexplained details might









## 14. X-Ray Fluorescence Investigation of the Shroud of Turin. 1980.

R.A. Morris, L.A Schwalbe, and J.R. London.  "[X-Ray Fluorescence Investigation of the Shroud of Turin](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/XRay%20Fluorescence%20Morris%20Schwalbe%20London%201980%20OCRsm.pdf)."  X-Ray Spectrometry.  1980.

All three authors were experts in X-ray fluorescence and members of STURP who performed X-Ray fluorescence on shroud in 1978 to detect what elements are present.

**What and how they scanned:**

"The available equipment allowed detection of elements with atomic numbers greater than 16."

"The geometry of the detector system, illustrated in Fig. 3, defined the 1.3 cm2 sample area on the cloth. The X-ray tube , detector and lead shields were mounted on a prealigned plate that was supported by a heavy duty tripod. For a series of spectra, we positioned and aligned the system toward a well-defined spot on the shroud and then simply raised or lowered it as a unit to collect data along a scan line."

"We collected a total of 37 spectra; these included room and instrumentatron background , calibration and shroud data. The latter were chosen to cover a wide range of image intensities as well as cloth background and 'blood' stains. Two scans of data , one near the dorsal foot image (1 - 7) and one across the face (9 - 18), are mapped in Figs 4 and 5 respectively. In addition to these, we collected individual spectra over an anomalous dark spot on the foot (8), a pristine cloth area (19), a scorch (20), a sewn patch (21)" one eye (22) and the 'blood' stain at the side (23). The low-energy radiographs2 showed no obvious high-Z inclusions in any of these areas."

**All non-blood areas are similar:** "We found that all spectra from the 'non-blood' areas were qualitatively quite similar to one another and that they could generally be distinguished from those taken at the 'blood' stains. "

**Images and dyes are unlikely:** "One of the fundamental questions of the entire study is whether the image had been produced or altered by some form of applied pigments or dyes. A goal of the X-ray fluorescence study was to address this question by revealing any elemental composition differences between image and off-image areas.  Generally we have found no significant differences but must establish limits of detectability and sensitivity to make this conclusion meaningful."

**Image has no heavy elements:**  "There appears to be no evidence of heavy element concentration differences between image (non-blood) and off-image points which would suggest an obvious forgery."

**Not enough sensitivity to rule out jeweler's rouge as an image enhancer:** "To our knowledge, at present only one serious candidate, Fe203 (Jeweler's rouge), has been proposed as an image coloring agent. Even its use is now considered limited at most to the enhancement of some faint pre-existing image.9 ... The test indicates, therefore, that iron fluorescence signal intensities in the shroud image areas should correlate with reflected density variations larger than 0.05 if the Fe203 hypothesis were valid. We believe this precision is not sufficient to adequately test the theory and suggest that sensitivity limits of future experiments be greater by at least a factor of 5 than those attained here. Moreover, in view of the sizable background variations, they should also include a greater number of sampled areas."

## 15.  Radiographic Examination of the Shroud of Turin-a Preliminary Report, 1979.

Mottern, Robert W., J. Ronald London, and Roger A. Morris.  "[Radiographic Examination of the Shroud of Turin-a Preliminary Report](https://shroud.com/pdfs/Radiographic%20Examination%20Preliminary%20Report%20Mottern%20London%20Morris%201979%20OCRsm.pdf)."  Materials Evaluation.  1979.

The three authors of the paper are STURP members and experts in image analysis, x-ray radiography, and x-ray fluorescence who performed x-ray analysis on the shroud in 1978.

Not much interesting in this paper.

"The Shroud of Turin was radiographed completely with forty-two pairs of Class I films."

**Three in one herringbone:** "Many details of both cloths are readily observable. The weave pattern of the linen is 3:1 twill which produces a herringbone weave."

**Holland cloth is 3 pieces:, thicker** "the holland cloth is not one piece but instead three pieces hand sewn together."

"Also noted above, the holland backing cloth has a range of thread diameters (0.1 to 0.45mm). A median value of .27 for the backing cloth was used arbitrarily."

**Side seam:** "Delorenzi reported9 that the seam is 4-5mm wide and contains the kind of stitch used to join two cloths which lack a selvage. The radiographic images substantiate the 4-5mm width of the "seam." In addition, two rows of stitches, one along each edge of the "seam," are observable. It was estimated, from the degree of radiographic opacity, that the seam may be four thicknesses of cloth."

**The shroud is 99% cellulose:** "This test also showed that there was less than one percent of material other than cellulose, or its radiographic equivalent"

**Cloth thickness:** "A few measurements indicate that the linen threads are rather uniform 0.15 mm"

"The cloth thicknesses were taken to be twice the diameter of the thread measurements."

**Shroud density:** "From Timossi's value of 23.4 mg/cm2 cited above and the estimated linen thickness of .3mm, the specific gravity of the linen is calculated to be 0.78 g/cm3, not an unlikely value."

"The results of the x-ray fluorescence tests produced a range of areal density values from 29 to 42 mg/cm2 • A value of 23.4 mg/cm2 for the linen only has been reported and was used in conjunction with radiographic observations to give a value of 66 mg/cm2 for the combined value of the linen and cotton cloths. This is a significant difference and must be resolved."

**Proposed that possibly FE2O3 was a pigment used to create the blood stains:**  "Hematite (Fe203) has been suggested as one possible paint pigment that may have been used to create the "bloodstains." For this reason, it was chosen in this work. If chemical analysis indicates the possibility that other compounds are present, their radiographic sensitivities can be calculated based on the information contained here. "

## 16. Spectral Properties of the Shroud of Turin.  1980.

Pellicori. S.F.  "[Spectral properties of the Shroud of Turin](https://shroud.com/pdfs/Spectral%20Properties%20Pellicori%201980%20OCRsm.pdf)."  Applied Optics.  1980.

Samuel Pellicori is a member of STURP and an expert in Visuble/UV spectroscopy who studied the shroud in 1978.  Here he discusses the spectrophotometric results.

**Blood**:  Page 1913, top:  "The bloodstained areas have the spectral characteristics of human hemoglobin."

"There is, however, sufficient correlation in the spectrophotometry to decide that the material on the Shroud is blood. In fact, the absorption spectrum of a blood particle removed from the Shroud independently suggests that blood is present. [Heller and Adler, 1980] Furthermore, the resemblance to blood as seen in the photomicrography of these areas is strong.  [Pellicori and Evans, 1980] The spectrum suggests denatured met-hemoglobin."

Page 1920, top right:  "The results of the spectral data analysis for the blood stained areas on the Shroud are consistent with their interpretation in terms of human hemoglobin."

**Believes image is from chemical:** From the abstract:  "A likely cause for the body image is cellulose degradation stimulated locally by natural or applied substances transferred to the Shroud."

**Image has 0.5cm resolution:**  "The minimum resolvable feature is 0.5 cm."

**Other STURP papers rule out pigments and dyes:**  "The observations eliminate the possibility that the body image is due to pigments or dyes applied to the linen."

**Possibly from perspiration or skin oil:** He put these on linen and baked it:

> Comparing before- and after-bake spectra, the myrrh, aloes (curacao), and perspiration plus skin oils all darken; in addition, the myrrh and perspiration plus skin oils become redder, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.  The Two perspiration-plus-skin oils samples are very different: P 1 (heavy) is a sample wiped from the back of the neck and was visually dirty before baking; P3 is from a light contact with the forehead and was not visible before baking. After baking, their resultant spectral characteristics became similar. The significance of this result is that, if the chemistry of the image imprinting process involved contact with natural skin substances (or myrrh), the pressure difference between the frontal and dorsal images of the body on the cloth would not register. ln the case of the Shroud, no difference in image density is detectable between the frontal and dorsal images.

> A further experiment was done using light coatings of olive oil on linen. Before baking these were invisible. After 1.5 hat 140°C, the spectral reflectance parallels those of aged P3 and myrrh. After 3.5 h, it parallels that of aged P 1. Extending the bake time to 5 h causes <0.5% average deviation from the 3.5-h curve. These substances approximate the body image spectral characteristics (Fig. 5) closely.

> The sample wet with tincture of myrrh and baked shows fibrils that are thoroughly stained. The aloes sample, however, contains small brown particles. There is no confirming evidence from visual microscopic or SEM examination of fibrils and particles removed from the Shroud that any of these substances exist as such today. Their original presence on or reaction with the linen in the context of serving as catalyzers or accelerators of darkening where contact was made is suggested. 

> Using the accelerated aging technique, natural perspiration plus skin oils, olive oil, and myrrh form visible stains that have spectral properties remarkably similar to those of the Shroud image areas.  This suggests that contact with a human body plus the passage of time played a significant role in the later appearance of an image imprint of that body. 

**Body image is not rust:**

> Similarly, Fe2O3 is not responsible for the image since the concentration of Fe2O3 particles predicted for the body image areas would be detectable. Figure 1 shows that neither the curve for Shroud stains nor that for known bloodstains is identical to the Fe20 3 curve (Fig. 6)... Fe2O3 is not believed to be the colorant for the body image because it visually is too red, and its reflectance curve is different from that of the body image (Figs. 6 and 7).

**Fluorescence:** "The light outline for blood in the lance wound area fluoresced noticeably."

**Shroud image is yellow:** "Under the microscope the image bearing fibrils look straw colored."

## 17.  The Shroud of Turin Through the Microscope.  1981.

Pellicori, Samuel. and Mark .S. Evans.  "[The Shroud of Turin Through the Microscope](https://shroud.com/pdfs/Shroud%20Thru%20Microscope%20Pellicori%20Evans%201981%20OCRsm.pdf)."  Archaeology.  1981.

This is a layman focused article with lots of colorful pictures.

**Shroud may have come from Constantinople in 1203:** "It arrived there [Turin] after at least two centuries of adoring veneration, near destruction and bitter controversy in the royal houses of France-and one unverified theory says by way of the Fourth Crusade to Constantinople in A.D. 1203."

**Matches crucifixion described in the gospels:**: "What makes this piece of linen so extraordinary is the fact that it bears the imprint of a body, the full front and back images of a man who has undergone what appears to be the tortures of repeated scourging and death by crucifixion. The scourge marks covering the body and the blood stains on the wrists, feet, side and head all correspond remarkably to the descriptions given in the scriptures concerning the crucifixion of Christ."

**Shroud is more detailed and revered than other relics:** "No other relic has been known to display such photographically detailed imagery of the human form. Throughout the ages, no other relic has been more revered."

**Man's height and weight:** "Suddenly the figure on the cloth, estimated to be that of a man about 5'10" tall and weighing 170-175 pounds, was brought to life more vividly than ever before."

**Medieval artist wouldn't create 3D heightmap** "This finding [of a 3D heightmap], confirmed again in 1931 by the French photographer Guiseppe Enrie, put proponents of the deliberate forgery theory over an impossible barrel: to suggest that a Mediaeval artist would have the foresight to conceive of a rendition having the qualities of a photographic negative encoded with three-dimensional information is preposterous."

**Italian Shroud of Turin Commission found no evidence of paints or pigments:** "Science would not get a first-hand look at the Shroud until 1969, and then once more in 1973, when church authorities permitted a group of Italian researchers to investigate it for purposes of preservation. Although they concentrated on textile studies and only briefly commented on the image itself, the Italian scientists detected no evidence-even under magnification-of paints or pigments in the image which their findings showed appeared only on the upper crowns of the woven threads. Thus the Italian work, unable to conclusively characterize the 'blood' stains, intensified rather than settled compelling questions about the Shroud for scientists and ecclesiastics alike."

**About STURP:** "Intrigued by the mystery and challenge of the Shroud, a small group of American scientists, headed by John Jackson and Eric Jumper of the U.S. Air Force Academy, proposed in 1976 to undertake an in-depth program of non-destructive research... October 8, 1978, it drew the immediate attention of the newly formed Shroud of Turin Research Project Inc.-25 American specialists in physics, organic chemistry, computer technology, x-ray analysis, hematology and spectroscopy"

"Our experimental "laboratory" was a room in the fifteenth-century royal palace of Umberto with wooden floors that fairly heaved at the slightest footfall. This meant that for fear of blurriness we could only work with magnification up to 20 times. An inappropriately timed step could produce vibrations that would be exaggerated 20-fold on film."

**STURP getting the lighting right:**  "A second and more common problem was the lighting. We attempted to regulate this by using a 500 watt tungsten overhead lamp (in addition to the palace's ornate chandelier) and putting black plastic sheets over the window. The second precaution served the additional function oflimiting the Shroud's exposure to the natural blue or ultraviolet in solar radiation that could damage the linen's (or canvas') cellulose fibers. We were able to prepare for some difficulties in advance. Extensive testing by Mark Evans, then a graduate student at the Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, helped establish the required illumination, exposure time and film calibration on a replica of the Shroud before the trip to Turin. At the palace in Turin itself, we then extended the range of exposures to compensate for local exigencies and improve the chances of success."

**Perhaps Most studied:**  "Perhaps no work of art or archaeology has ever been so intensively studied as the Shroud was about to be.  To probe the very atoms of the Shroud's identity, a battery of the most sophisticated techniques available were brought to the task, many of them used in hair-splitting research on art forgeries and forensic problems: microchemical analysis, fluorescence, radiography, infrared radiometry, optical microscopy, ultraviolet fluorescence photography, visible, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, and multispectral narrowband photography. A common object of these tests was to identify the elements present in the image to finally settle the question of whether it stemmed from man-made artistry or a more provocative and unknown natural origin.  Mysterious drafts coursing through the Mediaeval palace were similarly vexing, given the fact we were working with a virtual sail in the 14-foot cloth. "

**Superficial image:** "the water stains... penetrated the linen's threads to all depths, including around bends and into crevices in the fiber, which made for a darkish brown saturated appearance... The scorches, on the other hand, altered the coloring of the bulk of each fibril to a constant density-that is, also regardless of bends and crevices. But as might be expected from a scorch, these marks had a diffuse and gradual boundary. The body stains, however, appear lighter and straw yellow in tone and, significantly, are generally restricted to the top three or four fibrils of each thread crown. In other words, this shallower coloration does not usually follow the bends or crevices caused by intersecting threads of the weave."

"The body image itself is a uniform, light sepia yellow color on the points of highest relief of the threads, or in other words, on the outermost surface of the Shroud."

**Blood is too red:** " The brownish color is as it should be-blood usually darkens through oxidization with age-but the red color is startlingly reminiscent of recent blood and not at all what one would expect after a minimum of 600 years"

**Real blood:** "But there seems little doubt that these stains, which peI1etrate to the reverse side of the cloth, are those of blood... Optical spectrophotometry and microchemical analysis have since confirmed that the suspected blood stains do in fact contain hemoglobin."

**Blood serum halos:** "In areas where the particulate clumps have been removed, they have the distinctive and correct homogeneous reddish-orange coloration. It seems that these areas were probably soaked with a colored liquid less viscous or dense than whole blood-most likely blood serum which separates from whole blood at death."

**No pigments or dyes:** "There is no indication of any artificial coating or pigments on the surface of these darkened fibrils."

**Halftone:** Some areas, presumably those where contact between the bo<;ly and Shroud was more complete or direct, simply have more of the darkened fibrils.

**Image on front side only:** "Yet even in the darkest and atypical of areas--,-the heel and nose-the image stain does not penetrate to the reverse side of the cloth and shows no evidence of any mixture of blood."

**Proposes that perspiration and oils created body image:** "Our photomicrographic observations on the linen's texture and subtle coloring, along with the laboratory experiments on perspiration and oils, suggested one possibility-such fluids simply accelerated the normal degradation and darkening of cellulose, the basic component of linen, which occurs through gradual oxidation and loss of water by exposure to heat and light... This strongly suggests that substances on the body once enclosed in the Shroud-either burial ointments, perspiration or skin secretions-transfigured the cloth through direct contact. Yet despite supportive findings by organic chemists on the image chemistry, not all scientists agree with our hypothesized mechanism of image transfer from body to cloth."

"The Shroud is not the product"of a clever Mediaeval artist. And we now have some firm and generally agreed upon evidence about what caused this hauntingly mysterious image-the accelerated structural degeneration of cellulose fibrils as a result of natural, chemically induced molecular changes in the material. The hypothesis that these changes were catalyzed by natural skin secretions or preservative burial ointments is in no way diminished by the absence of these substances on the Shroud today-they could easily have evaporated or even been washed away over the centuries.  To us, the idea that the image was transferred directly onto the cloth by skin contact remains the most plausible theory."

"But the Shroud is nothing if not an enigma. Critics of our hypothesis, some members of the Turin research team itself, argue that an image produced by contact alone could not have the unique, three-dimensional contouring found on the Shroud. The trouble is that even after intensive scientific investigation, we still do not have the detailed understanding of the transfer mechanism necessary to either verify or invalidate that charge."

**Image is not a scorch:**  "Ultraviolet fluorescence photography revealed that the body image does not fluoresce while the scorched fibrils do. In addition, the scorches are also subtly redder than the straw yellow body image."

**Walter McCrone did not participate in the study at Turin:**  "A more serious challenge, if only for the amount of publicity it has recently received, has been directed to our findings by a Chicago photomicroscopist, Walter McCrone of McCrone Associates. While not a participant at Turin, he analyzed some of the fibrils pulled off the surface by adhesive tape."

**Walter McCrone's ochre wasn't enough to account for image:** "In brief, McCrone says that he detected the presence ofred ochre- a pigment containing iron oxide and as with all paints, a binder-on tiny fibrils of the Shroud. This would indicate that the image was painted on and, in other words, is a deliberate forgery. Forewarned of these charges, the Turin research team made extensive highly sophisticated microchemical tests conducted by Allan Adler of Western Connecticut State College that detected no pigments or binders for pigments of any kind to a level of less than millionths of a gram; the traces of iron oxide that were found, on the other hand, were so slight as to be invisible to the naked eye. Further, they were no more abundant in image areas than in non-image areas. But McCrone insists that tiny colored particles can be seen at magnifications of several hundred. The argument is almost beside the point. The particles can't be seen by the naked eye. But the body image on the Shroud is visible to the naked eye and paint pigment is clearly not the reason."

**Blood from contact with body:** "For now, we do know that the blood itself had to be transferred to the Shroud by direct contact and not some mysterious burst of energy. Similarly, the remarkably fine detailing of the scourge marks revealed by ultraviolet fluorescence photographs would be impossible to obtain by any other means than direct contact between the body and linen."

Pellicori just repeats things here that he's already said elsewhere.

**Perspiration, oils and myrrh created body image:**  "In attempting to reproduce spectrally the body image, we started with expected skin substances such as perspiration and oils_.:_and also with myrrh and olive oil, two materials possibly present in burial ointments. On subjecting these compounds to the same accelerated aging procedure, we found that stains developed -and the stains closely resembled the body image coloration."

"[W]e have hypothesized that natural skin substances or applied burial ointments were transferred to the Shroud by contact with the body. These materials acted as the catalysts necessary to accelerate the degradation of the cellulose at those points where contact was made."

"The direct-contact corollary to our hypothesis meets with difficulty here because body features of large slope would be distorted by total contact; deep features. normally would not be contacted by a stiff linen cloth."

**Body image is different than scorches:** "Our team also found that under UV excitation the scorches emitted reddish fluorescence. But the body image does not fluoresce; instead, it absorbs the background fluorescence of the linen. Thus, the image appears black."

**Misc**

"There are no paints or pigments on the Shroud."

"The blood marks appear to be human blood."

"The body image is a result of degraded cellulose--nothing more."

"Doe any of this discount the possibility that the Shroud could be authentic?  The answer is no."

## 19. Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin, 1982.

L.A. Schwalbe and R.N. Rogers.  "[Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin](https://shroud.com/pdfs/Physics%20Chemistry%20of%20Shroud%20Schwalbe%20Rogers%201981%20OCRsm.pdf)."  Analytica Chimica Acta.  1982.

**Density:** "Edgerton prepared samples of linen cloth to conform to the most recent Shroud data (although her thread diameters were larger) and found an areal density of 23. 7 mg cm-2 • Edgerton's result agrees remarkably well with the value 23.4 mg cm-2 that Timossi [68] derived earlier using essentially this same approach. "

**Image from cellulose degradation, not pigment:**  "Several image formation hypotheses are addressed. Although no single theory adequately accounts for all of the observations, it is concluded that the image is the result of some cellulose oxidation-dehydration reaction rather than an applied pigment."

**No pigment/paint/dye:**

"No pigment particles can be resolved at 50X magnification in image areas. The image does not look like a painting by direct microscopic examination."

"Our observations of both clear and colored fibrils from a pure image area showed no obvious evidence for a coating of paint medium. The growth joints are clear and sharp with no evident meniscus marks. (Phase microscopic examinations [Heller and Adler, 1981] of fibrils from a pure-image area also showed well-defined surface erosion features which, we believe, give rise to the general "frosty" appearance of the image fibers in the photomicrographs.) It could be supposed that a sufficiently non-viscous or diluted tempera vehicle was used; however, it is then difficult to explain the absence of either 13 discoloration or liquid capillary flow into the deeper portions of the threads without, at the same time, postulating some unusual mechanism of application."

**Not glair, egg, size, or casein:** "In contrast, negative tests on yellow fibrils from pure-image areas would effectively eliminate all protein-based vehicles including glair, egg yolk, size, and casein."

**Blood is actual blood stains:** "Available data from the "blood" areas are considered and the results show these to be blood stains."

**Can't be seen up close:**  "Much has been made of the fact that the image on the Shroud is more readily perceived at a distance than it is at close range. At distances of four to five meters, all of the image features illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 can be easily recognized; whereas, up close, it is difficult even to differentiate image from non-image areas."

"If the Shroud image had been produced by an artist and if the contrast values at the time of its composition were comparable to those observed today, the faint image qualities suggest severe technical difficulties with execution. For example, if the Shroud had been painted, it might be expected that the artist would have stood first within a meter of the cloth in order to control the medium effectively and then at distances of at least 4-5 m to observe the progress of the work. Similar difficulties with other techniques can also be envisaged. Although the potential of human ingenuity in overcoming such technical difficulties must never be underestimated, any hypothesis that the Shroud is the work of an artist must satisfactorily explain how the problems posed by the faintness of the image were circumvented."

**Halftone, same on front and back:** "The image has a half-tone quality; its density or darkness is determined by the number of colored fibers per unit area. The hue of discolored fibers is the same on light and dark density areas. The front and rear images of the body show the same distribution of fiber coloration and maximum image densities."

**No capillary flow:** "Color does not penetrate the cloth in any image area [33] (see note 3) nor is there any evidence for cementation between fibers or capillary flow of liquids."

**Image fibers are frosty:**  "Fibers from the image area have a "frosty" appearance; that is, their surfaces show a more diffuse light reflectance than do the non-image fibers."

**Sticky tape samples takein in 1973 and 1978:** "In 1973, Frei [34] used sticky tape to remove samples of surface debris for subsequent pollen studies. The same technique was also used in 1978 by Rogers and Dinegar who took and documented a total of 32 samples from the Shroud image, "blood" stain, scorch, water stain, and background areas."

**Sticky Tape removed more easily from image areas:** "He [Rogers] also observed that the image-area tapes "lifted" more easily than non-image tapes suggesting that the topmost fibers in the image area were somehow weakened."

And brought more material with them:  "McCrone and Skirius [35], who first examined the samples, found two types of linen fibrils present, some clear and others uniformly colored yellow to faint yellow. Their study showed that significantly greater ratios of yellow to clear fibrils were present on the tapes from the image area than on those from the non-image areas. The yellow fibrils are considered to be the most important direct observations of the Shroud and subsequent photomicroscopic examinations indicate that they represent the dominant and probably sole visible image element."

**Walter McCrone likely got a false positive because he used amido black, which stains cellulose easily:**  " In our view, McCrone's inference has two problems: first, no protein has been observed by any method in pure-image areas as distinguished from "blood" areas; second, a more selective test must be employed, because amido black stains cellulose easily, making false positive results probable."

**McCrone's detection of Fe2O3 is consistent with blood flakes:**  "Mc Crone and Skirius [ 35] reported large concentrations of Fe2 0 3 particles for the "blood" areas, but Heller and Adler found most of these red particles to be "blood flakes" and not Fe2O3 • It is, therefore, possible that the "Fe2O3 " particle correlation with image areas reported by McCrone and Skirius is in fact a "blood flake" correlation obtained by translocation in the cloth folding. Jackson has experimentally tested the translocation hypothesis. From the sizes and positions of the burned holes, he has reconstructed the folded configuration of the Shroud at the time of the 1532 fire. Using these results, he then demonstrated that if the "blood" stain regions are assumed to contain substantial amounts of submicrometer-sized particulate material, a correlation almost identical to McCrone's is obtained by simple contact transfer in folding and unfolding the cloth several times."

**McCrone's other pigments are ultra-rare:** "McCrone and Skirius [ 35] also reported seeing a few particles of orpiment, ultramarine, azurite, wood charcoal, madder rose, and larger quantities of vermillion. Although these observations have not been confirmed independently, Heller and Adler note that the occasional occurrence of such materials may not be unexpected because the Shroud is known to have been reproduced by artists and was, therefore, probably exposed to pigment-contaminating environments. Most recently, McCrone [ 42] detected the presence of minute amounts of mercury(Il) sulfide in several material agglomerates tested from a single tape taken from the area of the side wound. The observation may warrant more precise x-ray fluorescence measurements there in the future; however, the data of Morris et al. [9] suggest that mercury is present nowhere in amounts greater than about 10 µg cm--2. "

**All other tests show no paint, pigments, dyes, stains, sweat, myrrh, aloe, etc:** Schwalbe and Rogers summarize the battery of tests to detect pigments, dyes, sweat, myrrh, aloe, and other such substances:  "Heller and Adler [Heller and Adler, 1981] conducted further tests on the fibrils to detect inorganic compounds. These results were consistently positive for iron and calcium but negative for manganese, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, arsenic, tin, lead, magnesium, and silver. Although these tests were not sufficiently sensitive to detect siccative (oil drying) compounds, they show that the yellow fibril discoloration does not result from any likely (non-ferrous) inorganic or lake pigmentation (see note 5 ). Additional tests for organic dyes and stains gave similar results. Heller and Adler could not extract the yellow color with strong acids, strong bases, or a variety of organic solvents including ethanol, methanol, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, pyridine, ethyl acetate, and acetone. Moreover, the color could not be bleached by strong oxidants (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) or by treatment with standard addition reagents such as iodine in the Hanus, and Wijs methods. However, they found that strong reductants, diimide and 14 hydrazine (though at a slower rate), could bleach the color of image fibrils. Tests for the presence of nitro groups, phenol groups, steroids, and lignin were negative, but the fibrils did show positive tests for aldehyde and carboxyl groups. Semi-quantitative tests indicated the greatest aldehyde and carboxyl concentrations for scorch-area fibrils, with lesser relative quantities for image and least for non-image fibrils. Shroud samples from the tapes and excised threads [Caramello et al, 1976] were examined by both laser-microprobe Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Results from the Shroud samples were compared with those obtained from modern samples of linen prepared by primitive techniques. No quantitatively significant Raman spectra could be obtained from any of the samples. The only unequivocal spectrum that could be obtained was that of the Mylar backing of the tape. There was no evidence for Saponaria or any other coating on the excised threads or image fibrils. Mass spectrometry was run by pyrolysis of the samples within the source unit of the instrument. Mass spectrometry should provide the most sensitive and general method for the detection of foreign organic materials. (The system was sufficiently sensitive to detect traces of polyethylene that had been transferred to an excised thread by contact with its wrapping material, for example.) Although these data have not yet been fully evaluated, some conclusions have been drawn. There is a significant difference between the Shroud and the modern-primitive samples. The latter were found to contain lignin. This result was not entirely unexpected, because independent microscopic examinations of the modern-primitive samples had revealed lignin with the phloroglucinol/hydrochloric acid test, although the same test showed none on the Shroud samples. The mass spectrometric measurements detected no foreign materials on the image fibrils. Neither did mass spectrometry show any significant difference between the pyrolysis products observed from control areas and image areas at the level of data analysis that is now available.  The results of these studies lead toward some interesting conclusions. If any of the expected dyes, stains, pigments, or painting media had been present in the image, there should have been some indication from the microscopic, chemical laser microprobe, or mass spectrometric examinations. Subjects of earlier speculation, which involve the presence of burial spices (aloes, myrrh), oils (skin secretions), or saponins [K.F. Weaver, 1980] , likewise receive no support. By contrast, the chemistry of the fibrils does indicate a difference in the degree of oxidation and dehydration of the cellulose structure between image and non-image fibrils. The microscopic and chemical data, therefore, suggest the image to be the result of some cellulose degradation effect rather than an applied pigment."

"Figure 5 [from Gilbert and Gilbert, 1980] illustrates that none of the spectral characteristics expected from normal dyes, stains, and pigments are observed. Included in the plot are the results obtained from a scan of (anhydrous) Fe2O3"

**STURP was setup to test painting hypothesis:**  In view of the vague historical references to a painted image, operations in the Shroud of Turin Research Project were planned to test this hypothesis thoroughly. 

**McCrone didn't give quantities:**  "Mccrone and Skirius postulated in their work that iron oxide contributes to the coloration of the image, but they gave no quantitative estimates either for the number densities of particles adhering to the fibrils or for macroscopic areal weight concentrations of the material."

**1532 Fire didn't heat the rest of the cloth much:** "Direct observation of the Shroud shows that it was subjected to very steep thermal gradients at the time of the 1532 fire, and a number of locations can be identified where scorches intersect image areas. Those parts of the image that intersect scorches were observed to have identical color tone and density as the image areas at the farthest (as folded) distance from scorches."

**Fire would've revealed some organic pigments:** "If the image had been painted with a proteinaceous, plant-gum-, or starch-based vehicle, the medium would have scorched more rapidly than the cellulose of the linen. No evidence for a scorched medium can be seen."

**So would water that put out the fire:** "The water used to extinguish the fire in 1532 migrated through the cloth in both scorched and unscorched image areas. No evidence has been found that any part of the image was water-soluble either before or after scorching.  Any hydrophobic medium (oils, waxes, etc.) that migrated through the cloth would retard water migration. It can be seen that water migration through the cloth was not inhibited by the presence of the image, although it was retarded by several "blood" stains including that at the side wound, for example."

**No brush strokes:** "There is no apparent evidence of brush marks that might suggest a painting."

**Scorch first tested in 1966:**  "In 1966, Ashe [ 47] suggested that the image was a surface scorch and produced experimental images on cloth by using a heated brass ornament."

**Scorch evidence:** "The strongest supporting evidence for the scorch hypothesis is found from the spectrophotometric work of Gilbert and Gilbert [12] ... there has been some disagreement abol!t the visual similarity of the image and scorches on the Shroud. In Pellicori 's opinion, the resemblance is only superficial."

**Scorch may have been from lack of oxygen:** "If the Shroud image is a scorch, the slight differences between it and the known scorches from the fire may be attributed to different ambient conditions during the two processes. It is known that in 1532, the Shroud was burned while it was inside a metal box [Wilson, 1988] and may be supposed that the oxygen in this environment was rapidly consumed...  Miller and Pellicori... found that scorches produced at various temperatures on both dampened and dry cloth all fluoresced yellow-green under ultraviolet radiation... These results draw the "air" scorch hypothesis into serious question; however, it was chosen to leave the matter as an open question for now... At this time, the most likely scorch hypothesis is that the Shroud image is a light "air" scorch produced at temperatures lower than those sufficient to carbonize the material."

"Because Jackson's studies have shown that three-dimensional hot-statue hypotheses are rather unlikely, we suggest that perhaps an etched or scribed flat-plate may have been used."

**Couldn't create image with radiation:** "our own experiments with intense flash lamps, and ultraviolet, visible, and infrared lasers have not successfully reproduced the color density and distribution observed on the Shroud. Although very short flashes are required to obtain a superficial discoloration, these radiant energy sources produced different relative amounts of products and, therefore, different colors. These studies also showed that high radiant energy flux tends to cause surface explosions and damage that was not observed on the Shroud image. The results suggest that so-called 'flash-of-light' hypotheses are difficult to support."

**Hot statue would leave "hot spots":**  "Moreover, at cloth-contact points one would expect to see "hot spots" or well-defined regions of enhanced image density that result from thermal conduction. No evidence for "hot spots'' in the Shroud image has been found."

**Acid painting is unlikely:**  "Concentrated sulfuric acid, for example, dehydrates cellulose to produce a convincing yellow discoloration; however, attempts to create an image with acid were rather disappointing. In particular, it proved quite difficult to control the depth penetration and densities of the stains. Also, unless the acid is properly neutralized, the continuing reaction can cause disastrous effects. Mainly because of these problems, an 'acid-painting' hypothesis seems rather unlikely, although the possibility cannot be strictly ruled out."

**Prefers chemically-induced cellulose degradation:** "The results of experiments with chemically-induced cellulose degradation have, so far, provided the closest approximation to the observed image characteristics; however, the approach has some difficulties. The problem of controlling depth penetration of the applied materials has already been mentioned."

**Vapor diffusion doesn't work:** "Vapor diffusion of the sensitizing materials from a three-dimensional model seems unlikely, because the image appears only on the thread crowns and not in the lower weave structure.  Moreover, a material distributed by diffusion would be essentially isotropic (l/r2 density) and susceptible to convective fluctuations, and, therefore, would not preserve the shading and resolution according to Jackson's arguments [50]."

**No historical mention of with cloth + pigment:**  "As another possibility, Nickell [Nickel 1978, Nickel 1979] described several contact transfer mechanisms that might produce the observed contour density effects. His latest technique [Nickel 1979] involves molding a wetted cloth to conform to the surface contours of a "suitable" bas relief model. The cloth is permitted to dry, and powdered pigment is applied with a cotton or cloth dauber.  There seems to be no historical evidence to suggest that any such technique was used before the 19th century. Thus Nickell's method, 'using only 14th century technology,' may at best represent a unique and subsequently forgotten innovation."

**Dehydrated cellulose:**  "The primary conclusion is that the image does not reside in an applied pigment. The reflectance, fluorescence, and chemical characteristics of the Shroud image indicate rather that the image recording mechanism involved some cellulose oxidation/dehydration process."

**No satisfactory image formation process:** "The dilemma is not one of choosing from among a variety of likely transfer mechanisms but rather that no technologically-credible process has been postulated that satisfies all the characteristics of the existing image."

**STURP is a non-profit financed by private individuals, all scientists are unpaid volunteers:**  "The Shroud of Turin Research Project is a non-profit organization supported solely by contributions from private individuals. This research is a product of volunteer efforts by all the project members."

#### Thickness and warp vs weft:

"Jackson and Rogers measured the fabric thickness of the Shroud at three widely separated points and found it to be 345 ± 22 µm. (Measurements of the Shroud plus backing cloth together yielded 615 ± 29 µm.) Raes [64] quoted 38.6 cm-1 and 25.5 cm-1 respectively for the number of warp and weft threads in the weave of the sample taken from the main cloth. Mottern et al. [10] estimated thread diameters to be nominally 0.15 mm. Edgerton prepared samples of linen cloth to conform to the most recent Shroud data (although her thread diameters were larger) and found an areal density of 23. 7 mg cm-2 • Edgerton's result agrees remarkably well with the value 23.4 mg cm-2 that Timossi [68] derived earlier using essentially this same approach."

**Frei's Pollen:** "In 1973, Frei [34] took similar sticky-tape samples, and found and identified pollen from 48 different plants, 'We stated that some of these plant species are native to central Europe, although others are Indigenous only to Palestine and still others to Asia Minor and the region about Constantinople. Frei takes this as evidence for the Shroud having been in each of these regions during its history and exposed to the environment. Very few pollen were observed on the tape samples taken in the present Project, and no effort was made to identify them."

**Resolution:** "Certainly, the resolution of the image on the cloth is ultimately limited to about 0.02 cm by the weave structure. However, when the term 'resolution' is used here we assume the existence of a uniquely defined parameter that is characteristic of a mechanism of image formation, as yet unknown.  Given this assumption, the 'resolution' can only be inferred by measuring distances between closely spaced but visually distinct image features; typically the lips have been taken for this estimate. Pellicori [1980] quoted 0.5 cm for the minimum resolvable feature; Jackson [Stevenson, 1977] used 0.6 cm in his theoretical studies. Later, Jackson suggested a parameter that pertains strictly to a model that involves a cloth-draped three-dimensional human figure: d/D where d is the cloth-body distance and Dis the distance between two marginally resolved points. He estimates this ratio to be about 1.6 ± 0.8 for the lips. All of these values should be understood as lower bounds; until the image formation mechanism is known, the resolution limit cannot be determined exactly."

## 21. The Shroud of Turin:  Viewpoint of a Forensic Pathologist.  1982.

Bucklin, Robert.  "[The Shroud of Turin:  Viewpoint of a Forensic Pathologist](https://shroud.com/pdfs/ssi05part3.pdf)."  Legal Medicine Annual.  1982.

"A shorter version of this article appeared in LEGAL MEDICINE ANNUAL, W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, in the July 1982 issue."

**Attempted no direct correlation between shroud and New Testament:** "It is a scientific and objective presentation with no direct attempt at correlation between the Shroud imprints and New Testament accounts of the crucifixion of Christ."

**Human image and blood, normal anatomy:**  "there has been general agreement among medical investigators that there is a human image and blood deposits on the cloth. These opinions were based on the physical appearance of the image and the stains considered to be blood. The body image is that of an adult human male. The proportions of the body are generally realistic and support the anatomic opinion that the image represents a human form. There are no elements of the image which do not conform to this conclusion and there are many features of the figure which are typical of a human.  Details of facial features, including eyes, nose and hair are examples. The conformations of the upper and lower extremities, as well as the chest, abdomen and back are clearly those of a human. The umbilicus can be identified and is in its proper anatomic location. The genital area is covered by the image of the crossed hands so that no details are seen"

**Blood, then image:**  "There is evidence to suggest that some of the blood deposits on image areas antedate the development of the image."

**Body size:**  "The imprint on the burial cloth represents the body of an adult male, 71 inches in height and weighing an estimated 160 to 170 pounds."

**Rigor Mortis:**  "The general appearance of the body indicates stiffness suggesting that rigor mortis is present."

**Crucified man:**  "There is much physical evidence to show that the individual whose image appears on the shroud has been crucified and that his wrists, feet, chest, head, and large parts of his skin have been injured by a variety of objects."

"[T]he author cannot help but comment that a remarkable consistency exists between the gospel accounts and the forensic pathological findings depicted on the Shroud of Turin."

**New details under UV:** "There are indented bleeding points at each of these sites and, by ultraviolet fluorescence contrast, the marks resolve into scratch-like linear lesions, each with three or four parallel elements."

**Serum separate from blood:**:  "Some of the other blood deposits on the Shroud show a pale aura around the area, suggesting a separation of serum from other blood components."

**Five types of injuries:** "The injuries on the body can best be divided into five groups: the marks on the skin, piercing lesions in the wrists, similar injuries in the feet, wounds on the head, and the wound in the chest. Each of these groups will be analyzed in some detail."

**> 100 wounds from sharp whip:** "The marks on the skin appear on the anterior chest as well as the back of the body where they extend from the shoulders to the calves. On the back, the imprints appear in a sheaflike fashion directed toward and medially from the shoulders. Each of the marks consists of two portions indicating that the instrument used was bifid [forked]. There are indented bleeding points at each of these sites and, by ultraviolet fluorescence contrast, the marks resolve into scratch-like linear lesions, each with three or four parallel elements... While the lower extremities are involved by these injuries, none are present on the arms or forearms. The appearance of these wounds is consistent with the application of a whip-like device having sharp or rounded ends which tore the skin in a characteristic fashion. The marks are difficult to count but they number at least 100."

**Crossbeam shoulder wounds:**  "Two large discolored areas over the shoulder blades are consistent with bleeding from surface abrasions as if a heavy, rough object had been in contact with the skin at these points. From what is known about crucifixions, it was the custom for the crossbar of the cross to have been carried by the victim, supported across the upper back and shoulders. It is quite likely that it was this sort of structure which produced the abrasions over the scapulae."

**Nail through left wrist, not palm, no thumb visible**:  "The imprints of the hands show that they are crossed with the left hand covering the right wrist. The outlines of four fingers are clear but there are no imprints left by the thumbs. In the left wrist area, there is a bloodstain which is composed of two projecting rivulets from a central source and separated by an angle of about 10 degrees. That this bloodstain is not in the palm of the hand can be determined by simple measurement taken from a site of the mark to the tips of the fingers. It is too far from the fingertips to be in the palm. A nail can be easily driven through the bones of the wrist, separating these bones but not producing fractures. This was done experimentally by Barbet6 and has been repeated by others. Since the right wrist is covered by the left hand, no puncture mark is visible on the right wrist. The fact that on the imprint of the hands no thumbs are clearly visible is explained by the penetrating pointed objects passing through the wrists having damaged the median nerve. The motor function of the median nerve is to produce flexion of the thumb. The thumb may either be adjacent to the hand or flexed over the palm."

**Bloodflow indicates arms raised 65 degrees, alternating by 10 degrees:** "From the angulation of the stain on the wrist as well as the direction of flows of blood on the forearms, it is possible to approximate the position of the victim at the time of the injury and subsequent blood flow. Blood follows the laws of gravity, and if one were to extend the arms laterally until the bloodstains appear vertical, it would show that the arm position was approximately 65 degrees above the horizontal at the time of the blood flow. The divergence of the streams suggests that two positions were maintained by the victim during the period of the blood flow. The difference in angulation is about 10 degrees and can be explained by the victim elevating his body by directing his weight toward the feet and then changing position to permit the full body weight to be supported by the wrists."

**Right foot against cross:** "A study of the imprints of the feet is somewhat less complicated. On the Shroud, there are two prints representing the marks left by blood-covered feet. The imprint of the right foot is nearly complete: the outline of the heel and toes can be seen. In the area corresponding to the metatarsal zone is a square image surrounded by a pale halo, and this represents the place where the foot has been pierced. The imprint of the left foot is less clear. Examination of the calves of the legs on the dorsal view shows that the right calf has left a well-defined print in which the marks of the whip can be seen. The imprint of the left calf is much less distinct. This, coupled with the fact that the left heel is elevated above the right heel, leads to the conclusion that there is some degree of flexion of the left leg at the knee."

"From the physical appearance of the footprint stains, it appears that the right foot was directly against the surface of the cross and the left leg was flexed at the knee and the foot rotated so that the left foot rested on the instep of the right foot. The sole of the right foot became completely covered with blood while the left did not. A single impaling sharp object like a nail was used to fix both feet in position, passing between the metatarsal bones. One medical investigator has presented evidence that both feet may have been impaled separately rather than together [Gambescia, personal correspondence]."

**Crown of thorns:** "On the front portion of the forehead are several blood prints, one of which assumes the appearance of the figure 3. This was formed by the blood flow following the normal skin creases of the forehead. Circling the scalp posteriorly is a row of blood prints and high on the scalp at the vertex are similar prints. Any puncture of the scalp ordinarily produces bleeding excessively because of retraction of torn vessels. To account for all the bloodstains on the head, one must assume that more than a simple circlet of sharp pointed objects was used. A cap-like structure with thorns at the center and periphery would account for the bloodstains on these portions of the head."

**Deviated nose, swollen right cheek and eye:** "On the face over the right cheek, there is a swelling and there is partial closure of the right eye. There is a very slight deviation of the nose and at the tip of the nose is an area of discoloration consistent with a bruise. Detailed photographs and microscopic studies of the cloth in the nose image area show scratches and dirt. These are consistent with the nose having made contact with the ground, most likely as the result of a fall. The deviation of the nose may reflect injury to the nasal cartilage, although this is less clear."

**Chest wound with water and blood:**  "The largest bloodstain on the burial cloth is on the right side of the chest. It covers the area of the 5th and 6th ribs. This stain very clearly shows separation of blood from a clear watery material. Some of the latter may be serum, but there seems to be much more of it than can be explained by a simple process of serum release from a blood clot."

**Cause of water and blood:** "Accumulation of clear serous fluid in the pleural space is very frequent and occurs under a variety of situations. It may be caused by a simple irritation of the pleura and, much more likely, by congestion related to failure of the cardiovascular system. Because of the posture of the suspended crucifixion victim, it is likely that some degree of congestive heart failure occurred. One of the earliest signs of this is the accumulation of clear fluid in the pleural spaces as well as in other body cavities, including the pericardial sac."

"In such a situation, if there were perforation by a sharp pointed object to the rib cage into the pleural space, there would be an outflow of clear fluid. If the piercing object were then to be pushed further into the chest, it would penetrate the pericardium and the right side of the heart and release a quantity of blood. This combination of blood and water would account for the stain on the front of the chest as well as the heavy stains which appear over the lower back."

**Cause of heart failure:** "The most logical mechanism for death by crucifixion is development of respiratory asphysia related to failure of the cardiovascular system from shock and pain. The posture of the victim, the duration of the suspension, and the lack of adequate support for the body weight all serve to promote a condition of diminished respiratory capacity, resulting in cardiac failure and subsequent fluid accumulation in body cavities."

(174+167.5+167+157+167+160+168+162+181+167)/10 = 167 cm

**Shroud image isn't too tall:** "One of the possible negative aspects of the Shroud of Turin is the fact that the figure depicted thereon is that of a man about 178 cm [3 4] (5' 10") tall and weighing approximately 175 pounds.[3,4]  This would appear to be rather large for a man living in Jesus' time-according to Haas[1] the classical mean height for Mediterranean people of that time was approximately 167 cm (5' 5-1/2"). Of interest here is the fact that of the ten adult males described in Table 1, one (Individual IV/3B) was estimated to be 181 cm (~6') tall and another (Individual I/1A) was between 170 and 178 cm (5'7" and 5'10"). Several are described as being very robust or muscular. This would indicate that an individual of the stature imaged on the Shroud would not necessarily have been overly large for a man living in Jesus' time."

https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Workshop%201977%20STURP%20Albuquerque%20meeting%20OCR.pdf

## STURP's 1981 Press Release with Conclusions:

https://www.shroud.com/78conclu.htm

**No paint/pigments/dyes:**: "No pigments, paints, dyes or stains have been found on the fibrils. X-ray, fluorescence and microchemistry on the fibrils preclude the possibility of paint being used as a method for creating the image. Ultra Violet and infrared evaluation confirm these studies."

**3D Image:**  "Computer image enhancement and analysis by a device known as a VP-8 image analyzer show that the image has unique, three-dimensional information encoded in it."

**No spices or oils or post-mortem biochemicals:** Microchemical evaluation has indicated no evidence of any spices, oils, or any biochemicals known to be produced by the body in life or in death. 

**Body contact can't fully explain image:**  "It is clear that there has been a direct contact of the Shroud with a body, which explains certain features such as scourge marks, as well as the blood. However, while this type of contact might explain some of the features of the torso, it is totally incapable of explaining the image of the face with the high resolution that has been amply demonstrated by photography."

**Contact with real human, not art:**  "We can conclude for now that the Shroud image is that of a real human form of a scourged, crucified man. It is not the product of an artist."

**Real blood:** "The blood stains are composed of hemoglobin and also give a positive test for serum albumin."

**Image unexplained:** "The image is an ongoing mystery and until further chemical studies are made, perhaps by this group of scientists, or perhaps by some scientists in the future, the problem remains unsolved."

# POST-STURP

## THE HEIGHT OF CHRIST According to the Holy Shroud.  1979

Crispino, Dorothy.  "[THE HEIGHT OF CHRIST According to the Holy Shroud](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssiheight.pdf)."  1979.

**In the 500s, Roman Emperor Justinian sent 3 men to get the height of Jesus from the Shroud:**  "Near the end of the VIth century, Justinian sent 3 men, “trusted, capable and expert,” to Jerusalem with instructions to measure the height of Christ from the imprints left by his crucified body on the Holy Shroud. From the envoys’ measurements, a cross was fashioned, coated with silver, studded with precious gems and covered with pure gold. The cross stood a lofty 183.5 cm. The length established by the Envoys of Justinian may have been accepted through the years and applied to the little monument in St. John Lateran."

But what's the source for this?

**Previous height estimates:** "Shortly before World War 11, an experiment was made using a full-size photograph of the frontal image. It was found that a man of 178 cm. (5'9") fitted the imprints perfectly when he lay down with the photograph spread over him and the bloodstains of the forehead, carpus and feet applied to the corresponding parts of his own person. An identical experiment was made in 1976 by Drs. John Jackson and Eric Jumper of the United States Air Force Academy, who suggested that Jesus was a man of 5’10” and weighed about 175 pounds.

- Lorenzo Ferri 187 cm. (6’1½”) 
- Prof. L. Gedda 183 cm. (6’0”) 
- Dr. G.-B. Judica-Cordiglia 181 cm. (5’10”) 
- Dr. Paul Vignon 180 cm. (5’10”) 
- Rev. Peter Rinaldi, SDB 180 cm. (5’10”) 
- Dr. Pierre Barbet 178 cm. (5’9”) 
- Rev. Paul de Gail, Si 172 cm. (5’7”) 
- Msgr. Giulio Ricci 162 cm. (5’3½”) 

The difference of 10 inches which separates the two extremes amply attests to the difficulties of the problem. The method and accuracy, competence and sincerity, logic and acumen of each researcher are, obviously, not in question."

**Anatomical observations:** "Easily perceptible on the dorsal image is the hyperextension of the right limb, additionally prolonged by the pointing foot, which rigidly retains the position it was forced to take, flat against the upright stake. The left knee, however, was bent, and the leg lifted upwards, when the left foot was nailed over the right.  The Shroud shows the left foot still twisted, as it was on the Cross."

"Although on the frontal image no indication of pelvic displacement is apparent, it would seem that the body-axis was broken to the Right, for on the dorsal image the gluteal zone pushes a full 10 degrees to the left.  The position the body took on the sheet is therefore radically unnatural."

"On the Shroud, the head’s forward tilt annuls the region of the throat, skimming directly from the beard to the upper chest. This forward curvature is most convincing on the dorsal imprint, where the distance from the shoulders to the occiputal region is distinctly exaggerated."

"As we have seen, the left knee was raised. On the Shroud, the result is a foreshortening of the thigh caused by the suspension of the cloth between the hands and the knee. The right thigh and hip appear flared, for there the sheet adhered to the flanks"

**Explaining some of the weird anatomy, long arms, fingers:**

"The chest is lifted and expanded, as Jesus died in the position of enforced inhalation. The volume of the chest is further widened on the imprints, because the cloth was tucked between the arms and the thorax. So much material was stuffed against the lance-wound that the right arm was printed far to the outside, as if dissevered from the shoulder. Forearm5 and upper arm are too long, due to the cloth’s wrinkling in the elbow."

"The right hand is separated from the forearm by folds in the cloth, while the fingers are elongated because: either they curved backwards in hypertension, or the fabric was tucked beneath them, adding the fingertips and inner surfaces as far as the middle phalange."

"From the surface of the abdomen, the sheet rose vertically over the superimposed hands, each one with the thumb lying inside the palm. The distance of this unmarked area would have been several inches before the sheet dropped over the top of the left hand. The carpus wound, therefore, registers much lower on the Shroud than it actually lay."

"An interesting detail concerns the tibiae. On the front, the tibial imprints are far too long. The right tibia measures 54 cm., whereas normally, on a man 180 cm. tall, it would be only 41-42 cm. The dorsal imprints show the same tibia, the right, to be only 37.9 cm. Two reasons for this extraordinary phenomenon can be seen on the frontal image: (1) the sheet made full rotation over the knee-cap of the flexed left leg, and (2), across the ankles lay deep, even folds, leaving on the straightened sheet a visual hiatus, as if the feet were not joined to the legs at all.  Faintly dark striae [stretch marks] extending almost the width of the Shroud cross this otherwise blank swath, showing clear evidence of deliberate folding. When the Shroud is laid out in its full length of 14’3” and width of 3’7”, the distances between the various points of contact no longer correspond to the true measurements of the body."

**Cloth laid down first, then body:**  "As there are no apparent folds or appreciable creases in the back half of the sheet, one can logically deduce that after the Sacred Body was laid upon it at the entrance to the sepulchre and the top half folded over Him, Our Lord was thus carried hammock-wise into the tomb, with the under-section of the sheet tautened by the weight of the burden."

**Estimating the height is too difficult:** "And this Divine Visage; shall we inspect this, too, upon plotting paper? It has been done; but the details do not concern us here, for the play of cloth over these damaged features evades mathematical certainty. Most experts agree that the cloth adhered closely to the frontal planes, following the facial contours over the forehead, the prominent brows and the orbital sockets, then being tucked under the tip of the nose.

One might be inclined to follow the advice of a devoted sindonologist, Paul Vignon, who wrote: 'Do not push too far these measurements; it would be a false exactitude. For all our precise calculations, the dimensions of the Man of the Shroud are inaccessible.'"





## Looking at the Turin Shroud as a Textile.  1981.

Tyrer, John.  "[Looking at the Turin Shroud as a Textile](http://www.sindone.info/TYRER1.PDF)."  Textile Horizons.  1981.

**No animal hair/wool:** "No animal hairs have been found in the Shroud, which would satisfy the Laws of Moses that wool and linen must not be mixed. It could be used by a Jew, so the fibre analysis therefore provides no difficulties to challenge the authenticity of the Shroud."

**Not Egyptian:** "It has been pointed out that the Ancient Egyptians spun their yarns with the spindle running anticlockwise to give 'S' twist, the direction in which the flax fibre turns when wetted. Since the Shroud yarns are ‘Z’ twist, the placing of the linen in the first century has been doubted."

"Having examined over a hundred grave cloths in these museums, I have little doubt that the Egyptians favoured ‘S' twist yarns and plain weaves."

**Other ancient examples:** 

"It is known that Neolithic lakedwellers in Switzerland had similar production methods to the Egyptians. There has also I been reference to a knowledge of twill weaves by these people."

"There is a working model loom exhibited in Norwich Castle Museum, the design of which is based upon archaeological finds that date from the late Bronze Age. It has three healds [shafts] and has successfully woven twill-based patterns."

"Woollen textiles with reversing twill weaves and `Z' twist yarns have also been found in Northern Europe dating back to the late Bronze Age. They are much coarser sett than the Shroud linen, but a cloak found at Gerumsberg is woven 2/2 herringbone twill with a ‘Z’ twist warp. The cloak has been shaped like the Rameses Girdle by dropping warp ends and was woven without seam."

"It is known that looms with four healds had been developed in China that were capable of producing complex twill weaves before 120 BC.  A fragment of a silk shroud from a child's coffin from the Roman period has been found at Holborough in Kent, which has a reversing five-shaft satin weave. The silk trade with China would very likely have passed through Syria."

mindful of the ferment of ideas that was taking place at the advent of the Christian era, and taking into account the high technology in the surrounding Ancient World, it would be reasonable to conclude that linen textiles with ‘Z’ twist yarns and woven 3/1 reversing twill similar to the Turin Shroud could have been produced in first-century Syria or Palestine. They were, after all, at the crossroads of world trade routes where cultural ideas would have been mixing for centuries.

**Multiple shaft / heald looms were also in medieval Europe:** "Turning from the Ancient World to Mediaeval Europe, although it appears that linen textiles similar to the Shroud have not survived in any number from the early 14th century, flax-was grown and spun, and looms with multiple healds operated by foot pedals were in use. One is shown in a painting by Pinturicchio in the National Gallerv in London."

**Much older linen has survived:**  "There would appear to be no reason why the Shroud linen could not have survived from the first century. Much older linen fabrics are available, for example, Tutankhamun's curtains."

"Flax fibres are not attacked by moth grubs, which require keratin to feed on, and other insects tend to avoid flax if they can because of its hardness. When boiled or bleached, flax has a high resistance to bacteriological attack. Under certain conditions of warmth, dampness and contamination, micro-organisms may attack cellulose, notably cotton, but flax fibres will resist damage well if kept dry. The most important factor in the preservation from decay would seem to be the purity of the fibre and the effectiveness of the bleach. Contaminants remaining from the plant would be more likely to be breeding grounds for bacteria than preservatives."

**Primitive loom:** "From a close study of photographs, it would appear that where the opposing lines of the 3/1 twill meet the reversal is a true mirror image, whereas in others, the twill drops out of true correspondence to give a herringbone effect. These changes may be faults in the weave because of incorrect drawing-in through the healds which could suggest a primitive loom."

**No more than four heads/shafts needed:** "No more than four healds [shafts] would be required to weave the linen and, even though the image appears upon the long, warp floats on the 3/1 face, the cloth would almost certainly have been woven back-up as a 1/3 lift to reduce strain upon the warp and reduce thread breaks. The Shroud might therefore have been a less formidable task for a handloom weaver than may be thought at first sight."

**Reversing twill (herringbone) prevents curling:** "Certainly cloths with reversing twill weaves are less likely to curl than plain weaves and they drape and shed soiling and creases better. It may be, therefore, that the Shroud linen was originally intended as an expensive apparel fabric that was hastily pressed into service for funerary purposes (Luke 23, v.53). On the other hand, the smooth surface of a twill would probably be an ideal base upon which a forger could paint."

**Threads were bleached before weaving:** "Their appearance would indicate that even though the cloth was piece bleached, the yarns must also have been at least part bleached before weaving, probably in hank form. Moreover, the difference in shade between adjacent individual yarns appears to be as great as between image and non-image areas of the cloth."

**Other scientists don't believe McCrone's paint hypothesis:**  "The Americans and other scientific observers are unconvinced by McCrone's evidence and explanation. Indeed, an iron oxide tempera suspension as weak as that McCrone says was used to make the faint image would be very difficult to manipulate, even if an artist was painting a positive image."

**Vapograph wouldn't produce clarity:**  "A view that was put forward by Vignon and Delage at the turn of the century, and which has since been presented in modified forms, is that the image is a ‘vaporograph’ produced by ammonia and other gases from a corpse acting upon oils, myrrh and aloes on the linen. It has also been argued that Jesus was still alive when placed in the tomb and that, as He revived, His body heat contributed to the natural chemical action. The difficulty here is that images formed by vapours and warmth are diffuse and lack the clarity of the Shroud image."

**Raes corner looks like a patch:** "Raes was clearly dealing with a seam and its sewing thread and with fabrics of different quality particulars on either side. If, however, one examines large photographs of the Shroud, the place where Raes' sample was taken can be seen between the main area of the Shroud and a rectangular patch. (This is close to the lower right foot of the frontal image.) This patch is below the ‘edging strip’ and appears in photographs as different in tone and hue to the main area. There is therefore some doubt as to whether the sample described by Professor Raes as ‘Piece II’ is the edging strip or part of a patch."

## New Evidence May Explain Image on Shroud of Turin - Chemical Tests Link Shroud to Jerusalem.  1986.

Kohlbeck, Joseph A. and Eugenia L. Nitowski.  "[New Evidence May Explain Image on Shroud of Turin - Chemical Tests Link Shroud to Jerusalem](https://www.baslibrary.org/biblical-archaeology-review/12/4/1)."  Biblical Archaeology Review.  1986.

"Joseph Kohlbeck is an optical crystalographer... Eugenia Nitowski is an archaeologist who has now taken the vows of a Carmelite nun.

Page 20:  "I became involved with the Shroud of Turin when an old friend of mine and a member of the STURP team, Ray Rogers, asked me to take some quality photomicrographs and to microscopically examine some shroud fibers.  Rogers had removed the fibers with Mylar tape during STURP's 1978 examination of the shroud."

Page 20, bottom right:  "In the course of my work with the materials Rogers gave me, I began to focus on particles of calcium carbonate on the fiber samples.  I wondered whether there was anything in the tomb environments of first-century Judea that might account for their presence."

Description of Jewish burial tombs.

**Travertine Aragonite Limestone:** Page 23, left middle:  "In studying these tombs, I noticed that this soft, moist limestone would continually rub off on my clothing, especially as I entered the cave tomb during excavations.

No investigation of the shroud had ever suggested examining samples of the limestone from a tomb in the vicinity of Jesus' burial place.  Could this limestone, which is calcium carbonate, be the source of the unexplained calcium carbonate particles I found on the shroud's fibers?  We obtained samples of limestone from inside tombs in the general vicinity of Jerusalem.  We then subjected thin sections of this limestone to microscopic analysis.

This particular limestone was primarily travertine aragonite deposited from springs, rather than the more common calcite. Calcite and aragonite differ in their crystalline structure - calcite being rhombohedral and aragonite orthorhombic. Aragonite is less common than calcite. Aragonite is formed under a much narrower range of conditions than calcite. In addition to the aragonite, our Jerusalem samples also contained small quantities of iron and strontium but no lead.

We then examined a calcium sample from the shroud taken from the area known as the 'bloody foot' because this showed a larger concertation of calcium carbonate than other areas.  This calcium carbonate turned out to be aragonite, not the more common calcite, and exhibited small amounts of strontium and iron.

Further analysis was conducted by Dr. Ricardo Levi-Setti, of the Enrico Fermi Institute of the University of Chicago, who put both shroud and Jerusalem samples through his high resolution scanning ion microprobe and produced graphs; these graphs revealed that the samples were an unusually close match, except for the minute pieces of flax that could not be separated from the shroud's calcium and caused a slight organic variation.

Of course, this doesn't prove that the aragonite on the shroud came from Jerusalem, but this could be a reasonable explanation.  Nevertheless, aragonite with these traces can no doubt be found elsewhere in the world as well as in Jerusalem.  On the other hand, those who claim the shroud is a 14th-century forgery need to explain how the aragonite got there."

**Real Blood:**  Page 24 bottom right:  "On the sticky tapes taken from the 'blood' areas are red particles (left).  These red particles are not found in other areas of the shroud... I then stored the three other samples I had immersed in Cargille oil.  Two and a half months later, I took out these samples to look at them again (left top).  Most of the red particles had changed from red to black; a yellow color was now exuding from the black; further examination of the black particles showed what appeared to be a cluster of cell-like structures where there was once a cluster of red particles  Those particles that had previously measured one or two microns in diameter now appeared tohave nuclei.  These apparent nuclei continued to change.  Over time, I continued to observe these particles with nuclei and gradually they became colorless and difficult to see.

Several conclusions can be drawn from these observations.  The red particles are organic rather than inorganic.  Absolute identification cannot be made, but most likely these particles are blood-related, as reported by John Heller and Alan Adler. [Heller and Adler, 1980]  Heller and Adler earlier reported the presence of blood using chemical tests.  The observations here are supportive of their analysis.

Some time ago, Dr. Walter McCrone of the McCrone Research Institute declared that the red particles he had observed adhering to the flax fibers on the shroud were not blood, but rather iron oxide, [McCrone and Skirius 1980] as could be found in red paint, hinting at the work of an artist or forger.  McCrone then proceeded to demonstrate a non-brush stroke technique by finger painting iron oxide onto a cloth.  We do not question that some strong iron oxide contaminant can be found on the sticky tape samples, but the red particles we examined were shown to be organic, not inorganic.  Accordingly, the red particles that changed cannot be iron oxide.  

There are other conclusions to be drawn from our observations.  The change in the color of the red particles over time suggests--for the first time--that the shroud is a dynamic rather than a static system.  Thus there is a continuous state of change, albeit at a very slow rate.

With this possibility in mind, we reexamined blood area fibers from other untreated samples (see above).  They showed numerous colorless or slightly yellow particles that may have originally been red and undergone a change similar to the changes noted in our study.  Particles in all colors were found on these untreated shroud samples, ranging from colorless to black, with red predominating.  In short, some of the now colorless, black and yellow particles may originally have been blood.  By contrast iron oxide particles show an even red coloration throughout and are not affected by age.  They cannot explain the blood-appearing substance that can be seen on the shroud."

**Image not from paint:** Page 25, bottom right:  "A further observation:  I prepared a massive catalogue of all the significant items to be seen on the sticky tapes taken by the STURP team.  This showed that there are proportionally not enough particle-covered fibers to produce the image.  In short, the image on the shroud must have been created by a change within the cellulose of the flax, not by the particles attached to the fibers.  In this, we agree with the STURP team."

**Origin of paint particles on the shroud:**  Note 13 on page 29:  "There are a number of possible explanations for the rare paint contaminant, if that is what iron oxide is.  Quite often an inscription concerning the dead was written in red paint above the niche (or kokh) where the body was to be laid.  Blue paint was used over earthen graves of the poor to warn people that a dead body was there and the area unclean.  Yellow was often used on ossuaries.  In addition, the tomb caves were often decorated with frescoes of various colors.  Any or all of these could have found their way onto the shroud in microscopic amounts.  In addition, medieval copies of the shroud were laid on top of the shroud to produce 'touch relics'; these could also have been sources of some types of paint contamination."

## Radiocarbon Measurement and the Age of the Turin Shroud: Possibilities and Uncertainties, 1986.  

Meacham, William.  Proceedings of the Symposium "Turin Shroud - Image of Christ?  1986 https://www.shroud.com/meacham.htm

"Finally, the original sample was taken [by Gilbert Raes in 1973] at the junction of the side strip (believed by some scholars to be a later addition) and the (selvage?) border (possibly treated to prevent unraveling, and certainly more subject to contamination than the main body of the cloth). It could not be considered as a typical or representative sample of the relic."

"No responsible field archaeologist would trust a single date, or a series of dates on a single feature, to settle a major historical issue, establish a site or cultural chronology, etc. No responsible radiocarbon scientist would claim that it was proven that all contaminants had been removed and that the dating range produced for a sample was without doubt its actual calendar age. The public and many non-specialist academics do seem to share the misconception that C-14 dates are absolute."

"For the Shroud, there is a 600-year history in a number of different environments and unknown handling situations, and a possible further 1300-year existence during which the object could have been in contact with virtually any natural or man-made substance in the areas it was held. To measure Shroud samples, one must therefore consider every possible type of contamination and attempt to identify and counter them all, before the measurement is made and a "radiocarbon age" assigned. Clearly, this result can only be considered as a possibility, at best a good probability, but hedged by many uncertainties. It would not be an absolute calendar date, and it would not "prove" the Shroud to be authentic or a forgery."

"the choice of sampling sites on the relic should be governed by considerations of possible contamination and by the desirability of measuring both typical and atypical samples."

"Like charcoal, the open cellulose structure of linen, especially aged linen, is highly porous, with large surface areas, and is particularly absorbent of organic substances in solution 'which can subsequently only be dislodged with difficulty'"

"Most if not all of the larger particles such as pollen and insect debris would be removed in ultrasonic washing"

"In addition to whatever lipid, protein or carbohydrate residues may have survived on the Shroud from preceeding centuries, there is mention, in a 1503 chronicle, of the relic being boiled in oil as a test of authenticity."

"My own tentative proposal for dating the Shroud is that at least five samples be taken: **1)** a single thread from the middle of the cloth, between dorsal and ventral images; **2)** a small piece cut just in from the edge next to the site of Raes' piece I; **3)** a piece of the charred cloth; **4)** a piece cut from the side strip next to the site of Raes' 11; **5)** a piece of the backing cloth sewn on in 1534... Selvage edges would be avoided."

Has a letter from Tite to Dr. Evin seeking a sample similar to the shroud.

"Dr. Tite had acquired from the Victoria and Albert Museum a 10mm by 70mm strip of 14th century cloth which he had cut into three equal pieces. These he placed into each "Sample 3" cylinder — to be switched later with each "Sample 1" cylinder containing the Shroud piece. ("Sample 3" was nominally from the mummy of an Egyptian child buried during the

Vial, Gabriel.  https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi3839part4.pdf

Studied the shroud during the cutting of the 1988 carbon dating sample.  

**3:1 herringbone weave:**  "It seems that the essentials have been given, notably by Vignon who, in 1938, defined the cloth as a linen 3:1 herringbone twill weave."

"The structure is a 3:1 twill with symmetrical points composed theoretically of: 41 threads in the straight series 39 threads in the return series, repeat: 80 threads and 4 passes."

**Z-Twist:** "The "Z" direction is unusual. A long time ago, it was noted that the "S" direction, generally used for spinning linen, corresponds to the natural direction the fiber takes when it dries. It had been used since the first Egyptian dynasties and persisted in Egypt up to the XVth—XVIIth centuries.4 However, some authors have observed that "yarns produced manually with two spindles, spun simultaneously with the right hand and the left hand, must have a twist in opposite directions".5 The technique of spinning with two spindles was well known, not only in ancient Egypt but also in the Coptic period.6 Furthermore, although quite rarely, linen threads with a "Z" twist have been mentioned at Palmyra and in the Judean desert."

**Dimensions of shroud and side seam:** "There are two parts:  The main piece, whereon lies the image, measuring 4.30 m x 1.08 m.  A lateral band, attached by a seam, measuring 3.80 x 0.08 m"

**4 Shaft Weaving:** "The weaving required 4 shafts threaded from the back to the front for the straight series and from the front to the back for the return series. In the traditional method of weaving, the shafts were operated by means of pedals that the weaver maneuvers with the passage of each shot of weft."

**Side strip was originally part of the shroud:** "The irregularities in the spun weft and the thread count have been commented on by observers, especially after the X-rays straddling the two parts of the shroud.9 Beginning in the main piece, these irregularities extend into the sidestrip. We can deduce that this was resewn onto the main piece very soon after it had been cut, and in any case while the two lengths were still identical, permitting an almost perfect alignment."

"That the sidestrip comes from the same original fabric as the main piece can be confirmed by a systematic thread count (at least 20 or so) taken symmetrically from the two pieces of the document."

**Faults show archaic method:** "Of the two types of faults seen in Figure 4, the implication is that the archaic method was used to make the cloth of the Shroud. Unfortunately, we do not yet know when the modern method began to be used. Daniel De Jonghe10 has remarked only that this type of fault disappeared in the chevrons of canvas used for paintings of the XVIIIth century. We can only note the comparative interest that their detection can hold."

Archaic method is still used in Malaysia today.

**Not comparable to other fabrics:** "The only herringbone in linen so far analysed and published is that cited in note 10. It is very late — second half of the XVIth century — and much simpler than that of Turin. The number of threads per centimeter in its main warp is practically half of the Turin count (19.5 instead of 38) and the proportion of warp/weft reductions is less: 19.5/16 = 1.22 instead of 38/26 = 1.46 for Turin. The important main warp of the latter thus offered a much smoother surface to the reproduction of the image. 

If one takes into account the three constitutive elements of a textile — the structure, the primary material, and the reductions of warp and weft — one must acknowledge that the Shroud of Turin is truly "incomparable".

Rogue fibers found in the shroud, 1988
--------------------------------------

http://www.sindone.info/TEXTILE.PDF

Oxford found cotton fibers:

"Managing director Peter South explains, \`It was while the sample was
undergoing tests at the radiocarbon acceleration unit in Oxford that Professor
Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place. He mentioned
this to his friend Sir James Spooner, chairman of Coats Viyella, to which our
firm belongs. Consequently, after several telephone calls, the minute samples,
which looked like human hair, were sent to us.' The strange fibres were
magnified 200 times under a microscope and were immediately identified as
cotton. \`The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin
and quite old. Unfortunately, it is impossible to say how it ended up in the
Shroud, which is basically made from linen,' said Mr. South. \`It may have been
used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the
linen fabric was woven. It may not have taken us long to identify the strange
material, but it was unique amongst the many and varied jobs we undertake."

Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin, 1989
-----------------------------------------------

Damon, P.E. et al. Nature   https://www.shroud.com/nature.htm

"The sampling of the shroud took place in the Sacristy at Turin Cathedral on the
morning of 21 April 1988. Among those present when the sample as cut from the
shroud were

-   Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero (Archbishop of Turin),

-   Professor L. Gonella (Department of Physics, Turin Polytechnic and the
    Archbishop's scientific adviser),

-   two textile experts (Professor F. Testore of Department of Materials
    Science, Turin Polytechnic and G. Vial of Musée des Tissues and Centre
    International d'Étude des Textiles Anciens in Lyon),

-   Dr M. S. Tite of the British Museum, representatives of the three
    radiocarbon-dating laboratories (Professor P. E. Damon, Professor D. J.
    Donahue, Professor E. T. Hall, Dr R. E. M. Hedges and Professor W. Woelfli)
    and

-   G. Riggi, who removed the sample from the shroud."

"The shroud was separated from the backing cloth along its bottom left-hand edge
and a strip (\~10 mm x 70 mm) was cut from just above the place where a sample
was previously removed in 1973 for examination.  The strip came from a single
site on the main body of the shroud away from any patches or charred areas."

The three containers containing the shroud (to be referred to as sample 1) and
two control samples (samples 2 and 3) were then handed to representatives of
each of the three laboratories together with a sample of the third control
(sample 4), which was in the form of threads... The laboratories were not told
which container held the shroud sample. Because the distinctive three-to-one
herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched in the controls,
however, it was possible for a laboratory to identify the shroud sample."

"Because the shroud had been exposed to a wide range of potential sources of
contamination and because of the uniqueness of the samples available, it was
decided to abandon blind-test procedures in the interests of effective sample
pretreatment. But the three laboratories undertook not to compare results until
after they had been transmitted to the British Museum. Also, at two laboratories
(Oxford and Zurich), after combustion to gas, the samples were recoded so that
the staff making the measurements did not know the identity of the samples."

"The results of radiocarbon measurements at Arizona, Oxford and Zurich yield a
calibrated calendar age range with at least 95% confidence for the linen of the
Shroud of Turin of AD 1260 - 1390."

### Main points:

-   A 1cm x 7cm strip was taken from the bottom left-hand edge of the shroud,
    "away from any patches or charred areas," directly above a spot where a
    sample was taken from in 1973.

-   The sample was sent to labs at Arizona, Oxford, and Zurich, along with 3
    additional control samples of linen from other artifacts.

-   The labs were originally planned to not be told which samples were original
    vs control, but this was given up in order to have better pre-treatment. But
    "the staff making the measurements did not know the identity of the
    samples."

-   The labs were in close agreement and the samples had a calibrated calendar
    age range with at least 95% confidence for the linen of the Shroud of Turin
    of AD 1260 - 1390."

## Shroud irradiated with neutrons?  1989.

Thomas J. Phillips.  Nature.
https://www.nature.com/articles/337594a0.pdf

If the shroud of Turin is in fact the burial cloth of Christ, contrary to its recent carbon-dated age of about 670 years, then according to the Bible it was present at a unique physical event: the resurrection of a dead body. Unfortunately, this event is not accessible to direct scientific scrutiny.  But the image on the shroud, which still cannot be duplicated, appears to be a scorch, indicating that the body radiated light and/or heat. It may also have radiated neutrons, which would have irradiated the shroud and changed some of the nuclei to different isotopes by neutron capture. 

This flux of neutrons should have other measurable consequences. The neutron irradiation would probably not have been uniform, for example, so the 14C/'C ratio should vary in different parts of the shroud. In addition, other unstable isotopes should have been formed. Several of these isotopes have half-lives long enough that they would still be present, yet short enough that they are not found naturally. The unstable isotopes most likely to be found in the shroud are '"Cl and 41Ca. The presence of either would confirm that the shroud had been irridated with neutrons.

## Dating the Turin Shroud--An Assessment. 1990

Gove, Harry.  "[Dating the Turin Shroud--An Assessment](https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/viewFile/1254/1259)."  Radiocarbon.  1990.

Different cleaning techniques used by each carbon dating lab:

> Perhaps the most troublesome one is the fact that all three laboratories received a sample from essentially the same place on the shroud, and all likely would use essentially the same cloth cleaning procedures. This would mean that any contamination that is not removed by such cleaning procedures will equally affect all three measurements making them in agreement but wrong (cove 1989). In the event, however, rather different cleaning procedures were employed by and within the three laboratories, ranging from ultrasonic cleaning to much more rigorous and thorough cleaning techniques (Damon et al 1989).  ). Experts in the field do not know of any contamination that would not be removed by one or other of the cleaning procedures used...  Visible inspection by the author of the shroud sample received by Arizona before it was cleaned made it clear that no such gross amount of contamination was present. 

Ratio of contamination needed to throw off the date:

> Even if it did exist in the form of contemporary organic carbon, which is one way the apparent age can be reduced, 64% of the shroud sample would have to be such contamination and only 36% of 2000-year-old carbon to change the measured date from the first century AD to the 14th century.

> if the contamination were carbon that was contemporary in 1532, the mixture would have to be 86% carbon dating from the year 1532 to only 14% dating to the year zero

Sample was taken to another room:

> The same New York Times article states that an unnamed French monk charged that the British Museum official who coordinated the radiocarbon measurements substituted snippets of 14th century cloth for the postage-size shroud samples. The only time the samples removed from the shroud in the Sacristy at Turin Cathedral on the morning of April 21, 1988 were out of the sight of representatives of the three laboratories was when they were taken to the adjacent Sala Capitolare to be divided and sealed inside numbered stainless steel containers (Donahue, pers commun June 1989). During this time only the representative of the British Museum and the Archbishop of Turin were present (Damon et al 1989).  In addition to this charge by the unnamed French monk, serious questions have been raised by R Halisey (pers commun Aug 14,1989) as to why the sampling of the shroud and the sealing of the samples took place in two separate locations since that opens the possibility that a substitution could have been made of the shroud samples. This sample sealing procedure was apparently not videotaped although all the other operations were (Damon et al 1989). 

He says Michael Tite and others couldn't find a 3 in 1 herringbone twill weave could not be matched:

> In any case, the distinctive 3 to 1 herringbone twill weave of the shroud could not be matched as the British Museum officials discovered when they attempted to find such for control samples.

Says invisible reweaving is not possible:

> Another argument has been made (G Hoyas, pers commun May 2, 1989) that the part of the shroud from which the sample was cut had possibly become worn and threadbare from countless handlings and had been subjected to medieval textile restoration. If so, the restoration would have had to be done with such incredible virtuosity as to render it microscopically indistinguishable from the real thing. Even modern so-called invisible weaving can readily be detected under a microscope, so this possibility seems unlikely. It seems very convincing that what was measured in the laboratories was genuine cloth from the shroud after it had been subjected to rigorous cleaning procedures. Probably no sample for carbon dating has ever been subjected to such scrupulously careful examination and treatment, nor perhaps ever will again. 

Discusses the neutron capture hypothesis:

> One of the arguably more fanciful possibilities for the radiocarbon date of the shroud being in error has been advanced by T J Phillips (1989) of the High Energy Laboratory of Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (pers commun March 17, 1989). He has pointed out that the resurrection of Christ as described in the Bible was a unique physical event that was not accessible to direct scientific scrutiny. One cannot quarrel with that statement. He goes on to argue that since the image on the shroud appears to be a scorch, it suggests that the body on it radiated light and/or heat. From this he suggests the possibility that "it may also have radiated neutrons, which would have irradiated the shroud and changed some of the nuclei to different isotopes by neutron capture. In particular, some 14C could have been generated from 13C." This could have changed its apparent age from 1st century to 14th century AD. Phillips advances no theories as to how any biological process can produce intense heat or light, much less neutrons, even thermal ones. He does not remark on the astonishing coincidence between the date this ghostly neutron irradiation produced and the known historical date of the shroud ca AD 1353, nor does he note that, since the neutron intensity from such a hypothetical source must vary with distance from the source, the piece of cloth selected was at just the correct distance to produce the historical date. A piece closer to the image, on the Phillips' hypothesis, would have produced an even more recent date.   Had such a result been obtained from the AMS radiocarbon measurement, it would certainly have strengthened Phillips' speculation but would have astonished most of the rest of the scientific community. An elegant answer to Phillips was provided by R E M Hedges (1989). One interesting suggestion that Phillips (1989) made is that this same burst of neutrons would have produced other long-lived radioisotopes such as 3601 through neutron capture on stable 35C1. The problem is that chlorine is not a natural component of flax and, if present, would probably arise from contamination through the centuries. The radioisotope 36C1 can also be produced by the interaction of high-energy neutrons from, eg, cosmic rays with calcium. The AMS laboratory at the University of Rochester has the most experience with measuring 36C1 in natural samples. Even in the unlikely event that Professor Gonella, in his capacity of science advisor to the Archbishop of Turin, were to request that Rochester undertake a 3601 measurement on the shroud, the offer would be declined. 

Art historian says it matches the 11th century:

> W S A Dale (1987) of the Department of Visual Arts, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada, in a study of Christian art concluded that, if the image on the shroud were an artistic representation of the crucified body of Christ, it was an icon dating from the 11 th century. Comparing it with Christian art through the centuries, he asserts it was unlikely to have been created earlier than AD 969 or later than AD 1169. He remarks on the striking similarity between the frontal image on the Turin shroud and the Epitaphios of Milutin Ures in the Museum of Church Art in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Although this dates from between 1282 and 1321 (the latter being amazingly close to the measured mean date for the shroud of AD 1325), he argues that similar epitaphios sindons go back to early in the 11th century. Dale (pers commun Aug 11, 1989), who published this study before the radiocarbon measurements had been made, considers the possibility that the artist who created the shroud of Turin may have used this Belgrade icon as a model, or for that matter, that the artist who created it may have been the shroud artificer himself to be exceedingly unlikely. In his view, both artists were influenced by depictions of the crucified body of Christ layed out for burial that date back to the 11 th century.

Gove considered the history of the Raes sample too suspect to use for carbon dating:

> A sizeable piece of the main body of the shroud was removed in 1973 for examination by a Belgian textile expert and the whereabouts of this piece was so poorly monitored that, although it was allegedly returned to Turin, it was considered too suspect to be used for carbon dating. It was considered necessary to remove another piece very close to where this 1973 sample was taken for the recent radiocarbon measurements. 

## The Vertical Alignment of the Frontal Image.  1989 / 2014

John Jackson.  https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi3233part3.pdf 

Updated 2014 version:  https://shroudofturin.com/Resources/ShroudVerticalAlignmentoftheFrontalImage.pdf

It just says the image must be vertically collimated.

**Vertically collimated** "Thus, based on visual inspection of the computed statues, it would appear as though only a vertical mapping provides a reasonably consistent relationship between a "shrouded" body and the Shroud image. Such a mapping allows us to start a body surface computation with a cloth surface corresponding to an actual enshrouded body and compute a realistic "body surface" from the given Shroud image. Further, the computed body surface when draped with a cloth model of the Shroud appears to give nearly the same draping geometry as originally assumed. In contrast, an anatomically reasonable body shape does not appear to be derivable by the perpendicular-to-the-cloth mapping, nor by the perpendicular-to-the-body mapping (by inference)."

**Cloth distortions:** "(1) significant anatomical distortions exist in the Shroud image, (2) these distortions can be reasonably accounted for by an image process that maps body features vertically upward to a cloth draping naturally over a body, and (3) the perpendicular-to-the-cloth mapping between the same body and cloth surfaces would generate image distortions too great to be accounted for by natural anatomical variations. Thus, from this analysis, we conclude that only a vertical (or near vertical) mapping describes the frontal image patterns on the Shroud image in an internally consistent way."

**Must use the same function for cloth/body distance everywhere:** "In summary, it is the assumed invariance in the form of the intensity/cloth-body distance function with respect to position across the body surface, coupled with the necessity to compute anatomically reasonable body structure in regions where the Shroud is both flat and horizontal, that quantitatively restricts the choice of intensity/distance relation to the same function for all mappings. Stated alternatively, we cannot use a different correlation function for each mapping in an attempt to compute an anatomically consistent statue in each case because to do so would deform the small scale structure of the resulting statue in regions where the three mappings are degenerate or indistinguishable from one another."

## Forward to Fall-through Hypothesis. 1990/2014

John P. Jackson.  https://www.shroudofturin.com/Resources/ShroudForwardtoFallThrough.pdf

**Prediction confirmed in 2002:**  "The 1990 prediction was that the frontal image of the Shroud should appear on both the inner and outer surfaces of the cloth (as it wrapped the body), while the dorsal image should appear only on the inner surface. The reason for this difference is explained in the 1990 paper. In 2002, the backing cloth was unexpectedly removed from the Shroud during a conservation alteration which showed a doubly superficial frontal image (i.e. face, hair and possibly hands on the outer surface, albeit of lower contrast as compared to the inner) and a singly superficial character of the entire dorsal image (i.e. no evident dorsal image on the outer surface)."

"Moreover, a careful reading of the 1990 paper will show that the logic of the Radiation Fall-Through hypothesis does not, in any way, depend upon or require an assumption arising from Christian theology; rather, the logic arises strictly from what is observed on the Shroud of Turin image."

### Notes from 1990 Paper:



**Image must quickly before vacuum air rushes in:** "On one hand, the time scale must not be too short; otherwise the presumed inrush of the surrounding air into the mechanically transparent body region (which logically must occur if the cloth can move into the body region) would overwhelm gravity in directing the collapse of the cloth and this would preclude the observed vertical symmetry from occurring in the Shroud image (Item 7). On the other hand, the time scale for the radiation event cannot be so long as to be operative well after the frontal half of the Shroud has passed through the upper body surface. Such a circumstance would, in essence, destroy the signal-to-noise ratio of the image by creating a background discoloration that would "wash out" variations of image structure that correlate with body surface topography. These constraints might seem somewhat contrived, but it should be noted that these are but after-the-fact considerations concerning an image that already exists and must be explained."

### Notes from 2014 paper:

"This paper was presented to the International Scientific Symposium, Paris, on 8 September 1989 and was intended to be published in the Acts of that Congress."

**Overview:** My own words.  The body became mechanically transparent and the cloth descended through it from gravity.  Jackson calls this the "Radiation Fall-Through" hypothesis.

Figure B-0 to B-3 in appendix B shows how the cloth collapse would've worked.  I should take that diagram and make the cloth a different color.

"The dose accumulations corresponding to times T=0 to T=3 also illustrate that, as the collapse progresses, radiant emission decreases in intensity."

"As can be seen in Figures B-1 through B-3, the cloth is pushed away from the sides of the body during the collapse. Owing to the very thin attenuation zone, essentially zero dose is recorded in the side regions of the cloth.  This accounts for the absence of side images on the Shroud. Note, however, that blood transfer did occur by initial cloth-body contact at the sides of the body before the collapse event occurred (e.g., blood flow off the elbow) "

The figures on page 19 show how the body could radiate in all directions but capture a more intense and sharper image when the cloth comes closer to it.

Jesus often became "mechanically transparent" in the gospels.

**Back image is more like direct contact than 3D:** "While the frontal image is predicted to be "three-dimensional", the dorsal image is predicted to be one of "direct contact"... This means that image intensity should be generated on-the lower part of the Shroud only where hard body contact with the cloth occurs, owing to the strong attenuation in air of the emitted radiation from the body. Although studies regarding the intensity structure of the dorsal image have been inconclusive (Ref. 4), it is the opinion of the author that certain anomalies in the dorsal image indicate that it manifests a direct contact-like character. As can be seen in Figure 3, perhaps the most obvious is at the base of the shoulders where image intensity abruptly decreases in spite of the fact that scourge marks, which imply close contact of the cloth with the body in order to be transferred, are continuous across the body image discontinuity. "

**Blood doesn't line up with body image on the sides:** "In regions of the cloth which fell vertically downward, body and bloodstains should be in register. However, where the cloth is displaced laterally as well as vertically during the collapse, notably near the sides of the body, we could expect that the body and blood images should be in misregister. As discussed above, such appears to be the case for blood originating from the sides of the face but which have been shifted onto the hair images due, presumably, to a lateral movement of the cloth during the collapse. Another possible body/blood misregistration is at the dorsal foot where the body and blood imprints seem to be somewhat out of coincidence; see Figure 3. The Shroud image should be studied for possible misregistrations."

See figure 4.

"The fact that the blood feature and corresponding body image point do not occur at the same point on the Shroud means that the Shroud must have been in two different draping configurations when the blood and body image transfers occurred"

**Motion blur due to non-vertical cloth movement:**  "At approximately the location of the throat appears an image structure that is connected to the beard by an ill-defined series of streaks; see Appendix A. This structure might have been generated by a lateral dragging of the cloth over the beard for a several centimeter distance during the postulated collapse of the Shroud.

While the facial image is well resolved, the ankle region of the frontal image is not; see Figure 1. This might be explained on the basis of motion blur due to a complex wrapping of the foot region which in turn prevented a simple downward, vertical-only collapse of the cloth.

The edges of the eye and cheek appear to "sweep" outward into the void between the face and hair with reduced intensity; see Appendix A. Since a misregistration of the body and bloodstains has apparently occurred in this region (Ref. 14), it is reasonable to ask if this image feature might be a motion blur effect associated with a lateral movement of the cloth during the postulated collapse."

**Internal body structure / organs / long fingers:** "However, if the radiant emission varied with some physical parameter, such as initial mass density, then internal body structures might be convoluted into the general image picture along with the surface features of the body...

However, many researchers have noted the elongated fingers of the Man of the Shroud, as can be seen in Figure 1, and explained them in various ways (Refs. 16, 18, 19) including one by the author (Ref. 20). In the context of the collapse theory, the hand region might be an example where an internal body structure dominated the image which normally recorded body surface topography. In particular, the "elongated fingers" might actually be images of the internal bones of the hand extending into the palm region, which, as the cloth passed through the hand region, recorded a greater dose than the surrounding tissue."

**Frontal image should be on both sides:** "the frontal image should reside on both sides of the Shroud, whereas the dorsal image should reside on only one side. The reason is that when the upper part of the Shroud falls into the body region, radiation from the body impinges upon both sides of the cloth...  Unfortunately there are no suitable data available to test 15 this prediction because the reverse side of the entire Shroud has been covered since 1534 with a backing cloth as a repair to the 1532 Fire."

**Blood is a different color when it covers image areas:** "it is reasonable to ask if certain chemical changes might also have been induced in the blood which remained attached to the Shroud during the hypothesized collapse... I would like to note that the off-elbow bloodstain, discussed above, is a brown color, whereas the blood flow to which it is connected on the forearm is red, suggesting a possible chemical difference between on- and off-image bloodstains"

**Explanatory power:** "Thus, the hypothesis of a collapsing cloth into a radiating body appears to explain all known characteristics of the Shroud image and makes certain testable predictions, some of which have yet to be verified."

**VUV radiation can only travel millimeters through air:** "For wavelengths in the "Vacuum" or "Extreme" Ultraviolet region (i.e., less than about 150 nanometers), this type of electromagnetic radiation is absorbed over millimeter distances (or less) in standard density air. In addition, the photon energies associated with this radiation are sufficient to cause (non-thermal) photo-chemical reactions in cellulose. Finally, such radiation is absorbed over fibril-like distances in cellulose, consistent with the observed discolorations of the Shroud's surface fibrils."

**VUV makes cloth whiter, then the same color, then darker over time:** "

Discoloration effects of ultraviolet radiation on linen have been studied by the author. One experiment consisted of irradiating a linen sample, hand-woven like the Shroud (by Kate Edgerton), with the 254 nanometer mercury line at approximately 1 milliwatt/cm^2^  for five days. This corresponded to an accumulated dose of about 400 Joules/cm^2^ or, equivalently, photons/ (4.9 eV/photon). It is noted that, while this shortwave ultraviolet radiation does not lie specifically in the vacuum ultraviolet, its photon energies are sufficient to induce photochemical reactions in cellulose. 

After illumination with ultraviolet, it was noted that the exposed area was bleached relative to the background cloth. When exposed to long wave ultraviolet radiation the bleached area also fluoresced more than the background. The cloth sample was then aged in an oven at 150 C for up to 18 hours. At various times the sample was removed and a reflectance spectrum recorded from 420 to 680 nanometers at 20 nm intervals (excluding 460 nm because of possible spectrometer problems)5.  Spectra were recorded for both UV exposed and unexposed (background) areas. Visually, the bleached region discolored faster than the cloth background and took on a brownish color, similar to that of the Shroud image. The brownish color was restricted to the surface fibers since they had been exposed to ultraviolet radiation which is absorbed over fiber to sub-fiber distances. By inference, according to Arrhenius extrapolations, the same phenomenon should occur at room temperature, but over a much longer time scale. Thus, if ultraviolet radiation photo imprinted the image onto the Shroud fabric, subsequent, natural aging would have reversed the initially bleached image into the brownish appearance it has today. During this reversal, there should have necessarily been periods when the image was not visible to the naked eye.

The initial reflectivity of the UV sample is greater than that of the background which accounts for the observed "bleached" appearance. However, with time, the UV reflectivity "caught up" with and passed the background which also browned with time, but not as fast.

**Image area is redder, consistent with VUV light bleaching by VUV light:** "Note that for a given mid-band reflectivity the UV discoloration is always somewhat redder than the cloth background. The reason for the slight redshift is due to the initial offset caused by the bleaching of the cloth by the ultraviolet dose and this offset persisted throughout the aging experiment...

To this end, we note that Pellicori's color plot of Figure 3 in Reference 22 suggests that the body image is 25 slightly redder than corresponding light scorch regions of like mid-band reflectivity on the Shroud. This observation led Pellicori to speculate that the redshift might be due to a slight tint of blood (Ref. 22). However, in the context of the above UV experiment, it might be that the redshift in Pellicori's data is due rather to a color shift induced by ultraviolet radiation. Indeed, the bloodstains, also shown in Pellicori's Figure 3 plot (Ref. 22), are not sufficiently red to account for the redshift of the body image data points by blood tinting, as Pellicori suggests.

This impression is further strengthened if Gilberts' reflectivity data (Refs. 23, 24) are plotted according to Pellicori's color scheme. Like Pellicori's reflectivity measurements, the Gilberts' Shroud data (for the nose and calf) exhibit a noticeable redshift... the five Shroud body image data points (three in Pellicori, two in Gilbert) without exception exhibit a slight redshift relative to the background or unsensitized aging curve. In this regard, it is noteworthy that both the oven data and the renormalized Gilbert measurements for the 1532 scorches fall along a well-defined line which indicates that the redshift of the body image data, which do not fall on this line, is probably significant."

"Certain comments recorded on-site in Turin during the 1978 examination in official expedition notebooks by various investigators corroborate the above reflectivity data. One investigator (author) did not see any redshift whereas others apparently did. Thus, if the body image is red-shifted, the effect must be quite subtle as the reflectivity data suggest."

"The small sample for my analysis, cut from one extremity of the Shroud, included part of the seam that joins the main piece to a strip about 6-7 cm wide, along one lengthwise side."

"The fabric from the main piece, designated as Piece I, and that from the added strip, designated as Piece II, were examined separately."

"It must be pointed out, however, that in some of the preparations from the warp as well as from the weft of Piece I, traces of cotton fibers were observed. It would seem that the linen threads had been spun where cotton had also been spun... All the cotton fibers found in the linen yarn of Piece I, warp and weft, were of the Gossypium herbaceum variety, the number of reversals being less than 10. It has sometimes been remarked that these were superficial fibers having come upon the Shroud at times of the numerous expositions. If this were the case, it is scarcely probable that all the cotton fibers would be of the Gossypium herbaceum variety"

"At the beginning of our era, both cotton and linen were known in the Middle East; spinners often worked with both. It is evident that if traces of cotton are found in the linen, it is necessarily at the time of spinning that the mixture came about, and not at the time of weaving.\*"

"Until the advent of the Industrial Era, spinning and weaving were carried out in the same room, where piles of raw cotton would be heaped in one corner, piles of flax in another. Cotton fibers float about everywhere and stick to anything they touch"

"The sample examined is of linen in 3:1 twill weave.  It is not possible to affirm that Pieces I and II are different from each other, even though the weft threads of Piece II are significantly heavier than those of Piece I."

### Main Points

-   In 1973, Raes examined a portion cut from the shroud, with "Piece 1" being
    part of the main Shroud, and "Piece 2" being from the 6-7cm portion sewn to
    the side.

-   Piece 1 had cotton fibers in it, all from the same type of cotton plant,
    that would have mixed into the linen if it were spun (before weaving) in the
    same room as cotton. It is not cotton that accumulated after the cloth was
    finished.

-   In the Middle east, spinners often spun both cotton and linen in the same
    room.

-   "the weft [horizontal] threads of Piece II [from the side seam] are
    significantly heavier than those of Piece I," but Raes doesn't know if they
    are from the same or different fabrics.

 

Updating recent studies on the Shroud of Turin, 1996
----------------------------------------------------

Alan D. Adler, https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi43part7.pdf

"Nineteen assorted fibers representative of non-image, waterstain, scorch,
image, backing cloth, and serum coated fibers were extracted from the tapes and
characterized by previously reported methods. These were compared with fifteen
single fibers taken from three threads from the radiocarbon sample... These
samples were all examined by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
microspectrophotometry and the fibers were also studied by scanning electron
microprobe"

### Radiocarbon area has different spectrum

"the radiocarbon samples are not representative of the nonimage samples that
comprise the bulk of the cloth. This difference was also supported by the
scanning electron microprobe data that showed gross enrichment of the inorganic
mineral elements in the radiocarbon samples, even compared to the waterstain
fibers taken from the bulk of the cloth. In fact, the radiocarbon fibers appear
to be an exaggerated composite of the waterstain and scorch fibers, thus
confirming the physical location of the suspect radiosample site and
demonstrating that it is not typical of the non-image sections of the main
cloth. How much these differences in chemical composition actually affected the
accuracy of the radiodate is not clear."

### Blood w bilirubin confirmed in FITR and UV analysis

"Analysis of the FTIR data in Figure 2 compared with various controls show that bilirubin can be spectrally detected in both the blood samples and the yellow serum coated fibers in agreement with the previously reported chemical data... Bilirubin is clearly required to obtain a proper spectral match."

"The same conclusions are drawn from the near UV-vis spectra of the two simulacra. The clot simulation is in good agreement with the previously reported spectra of Shroud blood specimens and that taken from the on-site examination of the blood images on the whole cloth... Thus these two new pieces of spectral evidence completely reinforce all the previous chemical, immunological, and forensic work demonstrating that the blood images on the cloth are blood-derived materials produced from contact of the cloth with clotted blood wounds on a human body and are not composed of an artist's applied mineral pigment mixture."

### Cloth Image from cellulase oxidation

"Peak frequency analysis of the FTIR data also shows that the image fibers contain more conjugated carbonyl absorption than the non-image fibers, consistent with previous identification of the chromophore [coloring agent] with a cellulose oxidation product. Similarly, although the spectral presence of protein in the characteristic amide absorption regions is readily seen on the serum fibers, it is not detectable on the image fibers, as stipulated by the painting hypothesis.  This supports the previously published work refuting the painting hypothesis."

### Cloth image not from painting

"Numerous copies of the Shroud of Turin exist and it has now been thoroughly historically documented that several of these painted copies were "sanctified" by being pressed to the original. This process would clearly contaminate the Shroud with artist's materials by contact transfer. Therefore it cannot be maintained that the Shroud is a painting simply on the basis of the microscopical detection of such materials in the face of the large corpus of evidence against such a simplified explanation.  The accumulated physical, chemical, and forensic data do not support the contention that the images on the Shroud of Turin are paintings. In particular, the image studies very clearly rule against this supposition."

## The Crime Committed Against the Holy Shroud, 1996

Bro Brunno Bonnet-Eymard.  Shroud News.  1996.  https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/sn095Jun96.pdf

Arizona received two pieces:

"When we showed this photo to Gabriel Vial, the technical general secretary of the International Centre for the study of ancient textiles (CIETA), he exclaimed: «This is a souvenir photo; it is not scientific!» At least the document allowed us to state that the Holy Shroud really did reach the Tucson laboratory in the form of this two piece sample, and that Tucson dated it"

## DR. TITE THROWS OFF THE MASK

The Catholic Counter-Reformation in the 20th Century.  ?

http://crc-internet.org/our-doctrine/catholic-counter-reformation/holy-shroud-turin/appendices/

"On March 10, 1990, there took place at Haslemere, a small town in Surrey, a conference entitled “ *Fake* ”, given by Dr. Tite to about a hundred people of the Haslemere Museum Society."

"I then asked him [Tite] whether he knew the works of Brother Bruno on the Holy Shroud. He answered with a guffaw. I put the question again and, yes, he did know them. “ When are you going to answer the accusations formulated by Brother Bruno  ? ” – “ Who  ? What  ? ” – “ You yourself, and those who took part in the tests on the Holy Shroud. ” – “ We have already answered. ” – “ But you haven’t. Brother Bruno has proved that the weight and size of the samples taken at Turin do not correspond to the weight and size of the samples given to the three laboratories. “ He did not deny the accusation, but laid the blame elsewhere  : “ You’ll have to ask the Italians about that. Ask Riggi. It is for Turin to answer that question. ”"

## THE HOLY SHROUD OF TURIN II. The conclusion of a new trial: His condemnation to death and His resurrection, 1997

The Catholic Counter-Reformation in the 20th Century.  1997.

http://crc-internet.org/our-doctrine/catholic-counter-reformation/holy-shroud-turin/ii-conclusion-new-trial/

**Good Friday March 24, 1989  :** forty-five business men and “ rich friends ” *(sic)* give Professor Hall £1 million for services rendered, and notably for having “ *established last year that the Shroud of Turin is a mediaeval fake* ”.

As for the laboratories of Zurich and Tucson, they also refused to take part. Only Dr. Tite was present, as guest of honour, full of quiet good humour, smiling, and strangely surrounded by the consideration of everyone present. He stalled on every question he was asked, and returned home feeling very relaxed.

However, on the very first day, September 7, 1989, seventeen months after the event, the Italian Franco Testore announced for the first time the weights of the samples at every stage of their removal, on April 21, 1988, from the Holy Shroud  : a strip of cloth of 81 x 16 mm was divided into three pieces, which were then sent, under seals, to representatives of the laboratories who were present when the samples had been taken. There was a considerable difference, almost double, compared with the official dimensions published by ***Nature***. Incredible  !

Hall kept us waiting for his reply. Here it is, dated November 24, signed by his secretary  : “ Professor Hall has retired one month ago and is not willing to enter into any correspondence regarding the S of T. ”

But to our surprise, when contacted by telephone during the following days, and asked about the way he had cut the sub-sample photographed, he became evasive, did not answer our three urgent letters of December 13, 21 and 29, 1989, and then, for ten months, he kept absolute silence  ! He did not even acknowledge the receipt of our *Appeal to the “ twenty-one* ”.

***January 1990***. We ask the Victoria and Albert Museum for access to the reserve collection where the cloths from Canon Bock’s collection are stacked. They replied that this reserve was closed for reorganisation. Presumption was transformed into certainty  ; that is where Tite finally found his “ double ” of the Holy Shroud. 

As for knowing whether their sample n° 1 was in one or two pieces, Dr. Jull, who himself proceeded with cutting it into sub-samples, no longer knows. In our presence, he made several attempts on the board, trying to show, with obvious sincerity, how he would have cut the four sub-samples, taking into account the small additional strip admitted by Testore. Each time, he ended in five pieces  !

Toolin, the chemist who proceeded with the cleaning of the sub-samples, declared  : “ For me, it was in one piece. ”

Donahue, who was their boss, put an end to the discussion by refusing point blank to answer  : “ We have no photograph and no written record. ” That will be his last word....

Damon was absent, as I have said. We called him the following week from Paris. He replied clearly and with no hesitation  : “ The sample was in the form of a rectangle. Not a square, but a rectangle. I have my notes and I have photographs. ” ...

Donahue declared that the Holy Shroud sample received by his laboratory “ **was indeed in two pieces  : the one weighed about 14 mg, and the other 40 mg. The total weight of the Shroud sample was about 50 mg** ”. A strange sum  ! This time, he is telling the truth at last, but it does not tally with the weights we noted down from the laboratory notebook at Tucson on October 26. 

## Red Ochre and Vermilion on the Shroud Tapes?  1998.

Walter C. McCrone. 1998.  http://llanoestacado.org/freeinquiry/skeptic/shroud/as/mccrone.html

https://web.archive.org/web/20140427021114/http://llanoestacado.org/freeinquiry/skeptic/shroud/as/mccrone.html

"I, instead, found no blood and established the presence of Fe2O3.xH2O and HgS corresponding to two common artist's pigments of the 14th century, red ochre and vermilion, with a collagen (gelatin) tempera binder.  My microscopical studies were made on thousands of fibers and particles on the 32 Shroud tapes, each about 5 cm2 in area."

"Microscopically, the image consists of yellow fibers and red particles; the red particles are more abundant in the red blood images, and the yellow fibers are the major colored substance in the body image.  A carefulmicroscopical survey of the 22 image tapes and 10 nonimage tapesshows, without exception, tiny red particles in body- and blood-imageareas but no red particles on the fibers in the nonimage areas. Thered particles require careful high-magnification light microscopy(600-1000x) to see and identify. The results of my studies are basedon a total count of more than 8000 fibers on image and nonimagetapes. There are 10-26% yellow fibers in non-image areas and 29-72%yellow fibers in image areas."

"The red particles are found on the fibers of all image tapes andhave varying degrees of hydration, color, and refractive index (fromabout 2.5 to 3.01). These properties are characteristic of theartist's earth pigment, red ochre 4.  Common worldwide, this pigmenthas been used by artists for at least 30,000 years."

"The composition of the Shroud redochre was confirmed both by electron microprobe and by X-raydiffraction5. The XRD data were obtained on single red particleweighing only <1 ng of which possibly 0.2-0.3 ng is pigment. Lessthan one-half of the pigment aggregate particle is crystalline(hematite and vermilion), hence the lines in the XRD pattern are veryspotty and difficult to measure. The agreement with known hematite data is, nonetheless, convincing."

"The blood-image areas show incrustations of red substance withindications of «spalling». Many loose particles aggregates,picked from the blood-image tapes, show red particles different inshape and in color from red ochre, but characteristic of the artist'spigment, vermilion (HgS). The most common vermilion pigment is groundmineral cinnabar. The other two are synthetic mercuric sulfides, one a modern wet-process product, and the other, a dry-process form first prepared by alchemists about 800 A.D. The chemical composition ofthis second red pigment was established by polarized light microscopy(PLM), by electron microprobe, by XRD, and microchemically."

"The research I have done showsvarying ratios for the two different pigments, and proves there must have been two different paint applications, one a red ochre paint,and the other, a vermilion paint."

"One might argue that Fe2O3 could be formed byblood, but it not possible to explain HgS as vermillion except as anartist's pigment."

==TODO== Need to keep reading after "If the image on the Shroud is a painting"

#### Main points:

- Shoud blood is red ochre and vermillion
- examined more than 8000 fibers
- red particle refractive index from (2.5 to 3.01) matches red ochre 4, used for over 30k years.
- red ochre examined by electron microprobe and x-ray diffraction.
- agrees with knkown hematite data
- vermillion is made of synthetic mercury sulfides, one modern, the other first used in 800AD.
  - chemical composition established by polarized light microscopy, electron microprobe, XRD, and microchemically.
  - HgS (Mercury sulfide) can't be blood, is only an artist's pigment.

## Computerized anthropometric analysis of the Man of the Turin Shroud.  1999

Fanti, Giulio, Emanuela Marinelli, and Alesssandro Cagnazzo.  [Computerized anthropometric analysis of the Man of the Turin Shroud](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marineli.pdf).  1999.

**Height:** "The height of the Man, 174±2 cm, was therefore measured with different techniques and the results obtained were compared with the anthropometric indices derived from bibliography."

Figure 3.1 shows why the image is taller on the front than the back.

**Why it's difficult to estimate height:** "it must be observed that it is not enough to define two characteristic points such as the top of the head and the sole of the feet, and then to measure the distance between them. It must be considered that the cloth was wrapped around a man not lying completely flat, but rather with his legs flexed and his head bent forward.

The length of the body image must then be corrected, considering these effects and the fact that the cloth was not in contact with the whole body. For instance, the intensity variations of the image just next to the knee on the dorsal image and below the calves on the two imprints, frontal and dorsal, confirm the absence of such a contact."

**Previous results:**  "Many scholars endeavoured to overcome such obstacles trying to make opportune corrections, considering also the possible presence of folds [1] on the sheet. However one got heterogeneous results that indicated a height variable from 162 to 187 cm!... some researchers favourable to the authenticity of the Shroud are inclined to provide the lowest values for the height, while those who are anti-authenticity are inclined to provide the highest values."

**Not too tall:** "The authors who believe the Shroud is false claim that the Man of the Shroud, about 1.80 m height, was a giant compared to his contemporaries and therefore it wouldn’t have been necessary for Judas to give him the famous kiss to point him out in the group. However from recent excavations made in Rishòn Letziòn [2] it is evident that many Canaanitic men were very tall: many of them reach 1.75 m."

**Legs on the front are longer than legs on the back:**  "Figure 3.2 shows that, just because of the inflexion of the lower limbs, the length of the leg measured on the frontal side is longer than that measured on the dorsal side. In fact bending a limb, the center of rotation being just next to the knee, one will have a lengthening of the front leg and a shortening of the back one. Analogous considerations must be made for the position of the feet."

**Reasons knees are likely bent:** "By carefully observing the legs on the dorsal image, the intensity variations depending on a touch-doesn’t touch effect of the sheet are evident; such a situation is explainable if we suppose that the man has his lower limbs bent. The inflexion [1] would be due to the position taken on the cross and therefore to rigor mortis; the assumption becomes probable if one thinks what the natural position of rest taken 1 The numbering of the figures is related to the paragraphs in which they appear. Dorsal imprint legs outline Frontal imprint legs outline Frontal imprint arms outline Dorsal imprint tibio-femoral index Frontal imprint tibio-femoral index impronta frontale Frontal imprint radius-humeral index Comparison Race Dorsal imprint Comparison Frontal imprint Frontal and dorsal imprint definitive reconstruction reconstruction Yes No 4 by a person lying down is. Moreover, such a position could also be the consequence of postmortal stiffening.  The hypothesis is also supported by the non-flattening of some areas of the dorsal imprint, an effect that, because of gravity, should be present."

**Front and back images are super-imposable:** See figure 4.

"The first remarkable result obtained was to note that the two imprints are anatomically superimposable."

"In the case of the dorsal image the foot is bent, therefore the heel made a rotation backwards: for a foot bent 25°, the heel undergoes a displacement of 4.4 cm. Assuming the legs were bent at an angle of 20°, the lengthening of the leg image due to the contact of the sheet with the knee results of 2.1 cm."

**Front imprint is larger than dorsal (back) imprint:** "The larger width of the frontal imprint compared to the dorsal one is due to the position of the sheet: lying on the support surface, under the body, and lying on the Man of the Shroud outline in the upperside; the linear development of this one led to a greater deformation of the frontal imprint."

**Unknowns:**

1. **How much of the top of the head is on the image:**  "The sheet could have followed head roundness; in such a case, then, what it is measured is no more the real nape-vertex distance, but it is the one taken along the cranium outline. Such correction considers also the presence of the hair.  Dorsal imprint correction: -3% ± 1%2 .
2. **How much the head is bent forward:**  "It is not easy to define from the body image how much the head is bent forward; experimentally the two extreme situations (a=0 e a= max) have been taken into account.  Frontal and dorsal imprint correction: +3 ± 3 cm2 ."
3. **Lengthening of the linen due to mechanical stress:**  It is considered that in time the linen could have lengthened following the application of mechanical tensions. The assignment of the uncertainty does not exclude the hypothesis of lengthening absence.  Frontal and dorsal imprint correction: -2% ± 2%.
4. **Not knowing how much the cloth is stretched out:**  "The cloth wrapped the body of a man and it is extremely improbable that it was perfectly stretched out.  Frontal imprint correction: -7,5% ± 2%2."
5. **Not knowing if wrapping strips brought the cloth closer to the back of the knees:**  "While it is probable that the sheet in the back area was stretched out on the support surface of the Man, so much cannot be claimed for the legs. It has been supposed that the sheet could in such a way be brought closer to the back of the legs by a possible side bandaging (bandages), without which it would have remained on the support surface. · Dorsal imprint correction: -1% ± 1%2 ."
6. **Possible folds in the sheet:** "Because of the lacking of reliable data, the following correction is assumed (Ricci’s [1] evaluation of about 17 cm seems excessive): · Frontal and dorsal imprint correction: -2% ± 2%"
7. **Probable “S” bending of the backbone:**  "The possible effect due to the bending seems to have had some influence and because of the lack of data the following correction was used:  Frontal and dorsal imprint correction: +1 ± 1 cm"
8. **Compression of the intervertebral discs in a standing person:**  "It results from bibliographic data [12] that a man lying down is about 2 cm longer compared to the standing position because of compression of the cartilages in the standing position; this effect is concentrated above all along the backbone: · Frontal and dorsal imprint correction: -2,0 ± 0,5 cm"

**Bone length ratios suggest mediterranean or semitic race:**  "It must be noted that the Man of the Shroud’s features are very similar to those relative to the Mediterranean race (bold), even if analogies with other races cannot be excluded. Particularly, the tibio-femoral index of the Man of the Shroud turned out to be 83.8%. If the data is compared with the indices typical of different races, it is evident that the value is very close to that of the Semitic race, characterised by an index of 83.66%. This analysis cannot show that the Man of the Shroud was certainly Jewish because of the uncertainty of the data obtained (in the order of some percentage point) and because the data obtained by bibliographic research is not completely exhaustive, but it is certainly significant that an anthropometric analysis carried out with the greatest possible objectivity could have led to such an extraordinary result."

**Copies drawn from the shroud in 1516, 1643, and 1644 are less precise in anatomical details:**  "For a comparison a dimensional analysis of the lower limbs of three copies of the Shroud was carried out... In every copy of the Shroud, even a keen eye can perceive few real anatomic particulars, but the computerized dimensional analysis showed that the tibio-femoral indices are absolutely incompatible with that of the Man of the Shroud and the mean anthropometric one. 

Note how the tibio-femoral indices of the copies, that are among the most significant from the anthropometric point of view, are not only high compared to the mean one, but would mean a tibia length longer than the femur one. From this comparison results that in 1600 the anatomic knowledge and the techniques of drawing were still too lacking in reproducing such a complete and detailed image like the one on the Turin Shroud."



## ‘The Turin Shroud – past, present and future’, Turin, 2-5 March, 2000 – probably the best-ever Shroud Symposium. 2000.

https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n51part2.pdf

**Accurate shroud dimensions:**  "It was Dr. Flury-Lemberg who, immediately prior to the 1998 exposition, had the task of preparing the Shroud for its display and housing in the new three ton Italgas container constructed for it, working side by side with Sister Maria Clara Antonini of the Poor Clares. Because the plate for the new container had been made slightly too small, Dr. Flury-Lemberg gained permission to remove the blue surround that had been sewed on in the 19th century. The intention behind this surround had been to save the Shroud from the repeated handling at the edges to which they had been subjected throughout the long centuries when it was the custom to hold it up before the populace. However, the surround had ever since prevented examination of the same edges, thereby hindering totally accurate calculation of its dimensions. Now the dimensions have been authoritatively determined by Dr. Flury-Lemberg as 437 cm long by 111 cm wide."

**Large looms existed in the past:** "As she [Flury-Lemberg] pointed out, looms in antiquity, particularly those in Egypt, could be up to 3.5 metres wide, enabling them to turn out continuous lengths of cloth far longer and wider than the Shroud. The high quality of the Shroud's weaving strongly suggests it to have been made on a 'professional' loom of this kind."

**Side strip:** "The explanation of its side-strip would therefore seem to be that at the time of its manufacture it formed part of considerably wider cloth which was then cut lengthwise into at least three pieces, two wide, and one narrow, this latter being the side-strip, which retains selvedge along its length, just as does its opposite number. With the central section removed (and now lost without trace), the wide and narrow pieces were very expertly joined up to form the Shroud as we know it today, this thereby clearly having been made to conform to specific dimensions."

**Hems and side-seam closely resemble Masada stitching:** "Dr. Flury-Lemberg found the cloth's finishing, at its hems, and in the joining seam to have been done using an unusual type of stitching very nearly invisible on one side, and as such closely resembling that of ancient Jewish textiles as found at Masada, the Jewish palace-fortress that was overthrown by the Romans in AD 73, never to be occupied again."

**Warned not to carbon-date the edges:**  "Meacham called the 1988 Shroud dating a 'fiasco'. He pointed out that it was virtually unique in archaeology for radiocarbon dating laboratories to act as interpreters of their own results, yet that was precisely what happened in the case of the three laboratories who worked on the Shroud, a situation worsened by 'the extremely over-confident, over-bearing and haughty attitudes on the part of most of the C14 lab directors who were involved'."

"Meacham argued that the sampling of just one small section of the cloth, and without any kind of ancillary chemical analysis, had been particularly ill-advised: 'Alan Adler and I urged, pleaded, cajoled and literally begged for extensive chemical screening of the samples before being dated, and for at least two sites on the Shroud to be sampled.' Further, he stressed that even in the best of circumstances rogue dates are common in archaeology. In the case of more than one hundred C14 dates that he had personally asked for on objects ranging from Neolithic to early historical times, 78 he considered credible, 26 he rejected as unreliable and a further 11 he regarded as problematic. It was simply 'not on' to put radiocarbon dating in the position of being an 'ultimate arbiter'. But it was also misguided of Shroudies to suppose that the Shroud had yet been vindicated in the eyes of the world at large. Only a fresh, altogether better formulated carbon dating had the potential for achieving this."

**Pollen from Israel:** "Professor Avinoam Danin, who carefully itemised the plants of Israel that he had found represented on the Shroud both via pollens and via actual images, doing so with particularly impressive confidence after his having studied the latter at close quarters directly on the Shroud itself only 48 hours earlier (of which, see more below). One of the plants that he had been able to see directly on the Shroud, on the frontal shoulder area, was Gundelia Tournefortii, the same plant featured on the cover of Newsletter 50. And Danin reiterated the astonishing finding, based principally on the studies of his palynolgist colleague Dr. Uri Baruch, that 29% of the pollens that have so far been identified on the Shroud derive from this same Middle Eastern plant. Powerfully indicating that actual Gundelia plants have to have been laid directly on the cloth to cause such a concentration, Danin showed how if distribution maps of Gundelia and two other Middle Eastern plants represented on the Shroud are superimposed, then the conclusion is unmistakable that the Shroud has to have been in the environs of Jerusalem at some time in its history"

**Type AB Blood:** "The most prominent Italian to address the issue of bloodstains was Professor Pierluigi Baima Bollone, Director of Forensic Medicine at Turin University, who reiterated the essence of his findings, from his own exhaustive analyses of Shroud bloodstains, that 'there is no doubt that on the Shroud there are traces of blood belonging to a man, and that the blood samples taken from the foot areas have the AB property with regard to the ABO system'."

**DNA from lots of people:** "Inevitably it was important that DNA should be considered at the meeting, and it was Professor Marcello Canale who addressed this issue He pointed out that there were signs of the presence on the Shroud of DNA from a variety of individuals, including women, hardly surprising in view of the Shroud's multitudinous handling over the centuries, including by the Poor Clare nuns in 1534, by Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy in 1868, by more Poor Clare nuns in 1978, and of course, most recently by Dr. Mechthild Flury-Lemberg and Sister Maria Clara Antonini."

**Serum halos:** "In 1973, the last occasion in which I had been able to see the Shroud free of glass, the cloth had been displayed upright, so that the bloodstains on the feet on the dorsal image were way above my head. Accordingly what I had failed to see then was now, in the clear lighting of this year's viewing, readily apparent, that all around these bloodstains there is a particularly clear yellowish 'halo, one previously only noted via ultra-violet photography. Dr.Zugibe, with his long professional experience of studying bloodstained bodies, was able to confirm this as typical of the way that the serum of such stains separates from the rest."

**Body washing:** He [Dr. Zugibe] also explained how although it is natural for those of us without his forensic experience to suppose that the man of the Shroud has to have been washed prior to the burial, in fact he is convinced that the body was quickly sluiced prior to its being enshrouded. In his opinion the bloodstains that we see are typical of those he observes oozing from similarly sluiced bodies on morgue slabs."

**Flower imprint:** "Immediately Danin spotted on the cloth itself the Gundelia and other flower images, the presence of which he had earlier argued on the evidence of black and white photos. Such was his excitement that within moments he had caught the interest of Archbishop Poletto who, with Danin's retracted blue biro tracing the outlines only just above the cloth's surface, followed his explanations attentively. And as I too followed these (and Newsletter readers will have been well aware of my profound scepticism on the issue of flower images, as expressed in previous issues), I had to concede that the flower shapes that Danin was pointing out could not be dismissed as just quirks of photographic reproduction... And as he was now insisting with greatly increased confidence, the images of particular flowers of Israel with which he had acquired long familiarity were quite definitely represented on the Shroud's surface. For the first time I felt bound to bow to Danin's special gift and expertise, and accept that if Danin said that these were Israeli flowers represented on the Shroud's surface, then that's what they probably were. Even if the difficulty of my accepting the ancillary objects that Dr. Alan Whanger sees on the Shroud remains as large as ever."

Evidence for the Skewing of the C-14 Dating of the Shroud of Turin Due to Repairs, 2000
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joseph G. Marino. [Sindone 2000
Conference](http://web.tiscali.it/sindone2000/index2.htm). 2000.
http://shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf

"It is well known and documented that the Shroud has been repaired several times
in its history, including in the area from which the C-14 sample was taken."

"Enzo Delorenzi, also a member of the Turin Commission, made the very
significant statement: …I should like to mention the impression I received
during the course of my examination, namely, that more pairs of hands have
carried out the darning than is suggested in the historical records"

"we believe that the theory that the Shroud has literally been patched with
medieval material from the 16th century, in the C-14 sample itself, explains the
medieval carbon dating results... several other sindonologists have identified
various anomalies that also seem to point to undocumented repairs (Gervasio,
1986: 264, 268), which adds credence to the hypothesis that the C-14 sample area
may have been similarly enhanced."

### Quotes from those noticing out of place fibers in the 1988 C14 sample:

Giovanni Riggi, the person who actually cut the C-14 sample, which was from the
same area from which the 1973 “Raes piece” was taken, stated: I was authorized
to cut approximately 8 square centimetres of cloth from the Shroud…This was then
reduced to about 7 cm because fibres of other origins had become mixed up with
the original fabric …(Riggi 1988:182)."

"Italian author Giorgio Tessiore, discussing the sample taking, noted, “…1 cm of
the new sample had to be discarded because of the presence of different color
threads” (Tessiore, 1988:44)."

"Upon microscopic examination of the Oxford C-14 sample, Professor Edward Hall,
head of the Oxford lab, noticed fibers that looked out of place. A laboratory in
Derbyshire determined that the rogue fibers were cotton of “a fine, dark yellow
strand.” According to Peter South of the lab, “It may have been used for repairs
at some time in the past…” (Rogue Fibres found in the Shroud, 1988:13)."

"The late Dr. Alan Adler, a chemist and member of the STURP team that studied
the Shroud in 1978, noted: So you can talk all you want about how reproducible
the date is, but you can’t talk about how accurate it is. You have no way of
knowing if the area you took the C14 sample from represents the whole cloth.
That’s an area which has obviously been repaired. There’s cloth missing there.
It’s been rewoven on the edge. They even cut part of it off, because it was
obviously rewoven on the edge. The simplest explanation why the date may be off
is that it’s rewoven cloth there. And that’s not been tested (Case, 1996:73)."

It was determined that there was a statistically significant (P\>98.8%, r2
=0.49) inverse linear relationship between the date measured and the distance
from the sample to the edge of the cloth. This finding indicated that there was
an apparent gradient of radiocarbon measured on the Shroud sample with the
higher levels of C14 measured at increasing distance from the edge of the Shroud
linen based on the sample measured (Walsh, 1999)."

"It is our premise that the reinforcement with 16th century material occurred
following the removal of the 5½ inch x 3½ inch section of cloth adjacent to the
C-14 sample (see Figure 4). This may have occurred as a result of the will and
testament bequeath, drawn up on February 20th, 1508, by the Duchess of Savoy,
Margaret of Austria, who wanted to leave a portion of the Shroud to her church
(Wilson, 1998:67, 287). Margaret died around the beginning of 1531 (BSTS
Newsletter, no. 51, June 2000, pg. 43), at which time her last will and
testament was executed."

"Professor Raes, who extracted the above cited Shroud sample in 1973, believes
that in the 1988 Oxford sample he examined, the cotton he observed was contained
inside the threads, which could help to explain the difference in fiber diameter
(Raes, 1989). We believe that the heavier, blended material may explain why the
C-14 sample apparently weighed about twice as much as expected (Petrosillo and
Marinelli, 1996:63)."

### C14 changes over the cloth

"A striking similarity can be observed between the angle at which the C-14 rate
changes and the angle at which the disparate weave intersects the Shroud
weave... If one looks at the location from which the Shroud samples were taken
for each of the three labs, it can be seen that the C-14 dates correspond
closely to the change in weave percentage."

"According to Ronald Hatfield, a scientist at Beta Analytic, the world’s largest
radiocarbon dating service, a merging of threads from AD 1500 into a 2,000 year
old piece of linen would augment the C-14 content, such that a 60/40 ratio of
new material to old, determined by mass, would result in a C-14 age of
approximately AD 1210 (Beta Analytic Laboratories, 2000). This correlates very
closely with the Oxford mean date of AD 1200 as reported in Nature (Damon,
1989:613) and with the observed ratio of original versus medieval material in
the C-14 sample."

### Visible signs of re-weaving

"A blinded analysis of a photograph of the Zurich C-14 sample, by Thomas
Ferguson & Co. Ltd, world-renowned makers of Double Damask Linen, resulted in
their perception that the sample was "touched up to prevent unraveling." They
further observed, "We have to say that we see the twill pattern clearly on both
sides, but still there is something different left versus right." (Ferguson &
Co., 2000)"

"In a second blinded examination of photographs... European-trained weaver David
Pearson, owner of the French Tailors in Columbus, Ohio, immediately recognized
the disparate weave pattern and differences in thread size, stating "there is no
question that there is different material on each side…It is definitely a
patch." [(referring to what we have highlighted in Figure 2 as the pink
section)] (French Tailors, 2000). He stated that medieval European weavers would
typically try to match the original cloth and then hand-stitch approximately ½
inch of new material into the old, such that it was invisible to all but the
trained eye... This type of detail to repairs would be consistent with the
wealth and devotion of the Savoy family, who owned the Shroud at the time."

"In a third blinded analysis of the Zurich C-14 sample, by Albany International,
Louise Harner remarked that “the float [horizontal thread pattern] is different
on either side of the sample”"

"Due to its adjacent location next to the excised region and C-14 sample, it is
highly likely that the Raes sample [the part given to Gilbert Raes in 1973,
directly above the 1988 sample] also contained the 16th century patch. In Raes’
examinations of his 1973 samples (Raes, 1976:86) and the 1988 Oxford C-14 sample
(Raes, 1989), he reported the presence of cotton fibers. More importantly, he
detected two pieces of material sewn together, noting, “The thread used for
sewing the two pieces together is…twisted in an S-direction, whereas the
individual threads are twisted in a Z-direction” (Raes 1976:85). Here Raes is
referring to the connection between the fabric and the seam, which raises
further suspicions of a patch, since studies have shown that the side strip is,
in actuality, a continuation of the main Shroud (Schwalbe and Rogers, 1982:42;
Adler, 1997)."

### Main Points:

-   Several researchers taking the 1988 samples say there was foreign material
    mixed with them.
-   C14 concentration decreases as you move inward from the edge.
-   A section of the Shroud was removed in 1531 to donate to a church, just
    before the 1532 fire.
-   Three linen experts, in a blinded analysis, were given photos of the area
    where the 1988 material was taken. All three remarked that it looked like it
    was patched.
-   The photos in the paper showing a seam at where the sample was taken are too
    blurry for me to make sense of.



## Further Spectroscopic Investigations of Samples of the Shroud of Turin.  2000

Adler, Alan D., Russel Selzer, and Frank DeBlase.   "[Further Spectroscopic Investigations of Samples of the Shroud of Turin](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi43part9.pdf)."  Proceedings of the 1998 Dallas Shroud Symposium.  2000

**They used shroud fibers from STURP:** "Five fibers representing non-image areas in the vicinity of the feet, the waist, and the head of the frontal image were collected from their designated sample tapes. Similarly, four waterstain fibers from the head and knee areas, four scorch fibers from the knee area, two serum coated fibers from the edge of the lance wound, two image fibers from the finger area, two backing cloth fibers from the area adjacent to the radiodate sample area, and two blood globs (particles unattached to fibers) from the lance wound area were also isolated for investigation."

**Encrustations on radiocarbon corner:** "The administrators of the radiodate sampling, L. Gonella and G. Riggi, kindly provided three threads from the radiocarbon sample for our study. Two were warp threads from the outer and inner edges of the trimmed sample and the third was a -weft thread from the middle of this sample. Five fibers were taken from each of these samples for comparison with those collected from the sticky tapes. Interestingly, under microscopic investigation, these samples resembled exaggerated versions of the waterstained specimens. They were non-fluorescent, unevenly colored from dark yellow to splotchy brown, roughly surfaced (even showing patchy encrustations in spots) and showed a very strong and variably multicolored birefringence pattern. Considerable microdebris was also evident."

...

"[A] great deal of variability was evidenced in the radiocarbon samples. Some of the patchy encrustations were so thick as to mask the underlying carbon of fibers whose continuity were clearly obvious in the microscope images."

**Large FTIR variation in radiocarbon sample:** "It should be noted that there is more variation in the patterns of the radiocarbon samples representing an area of a few square centimeters than in those of the non-image samples taken from areas a whole body-image length apart."

...

"The peak patterns and relative intensity patterns in other regions of the spectra are also consistent with the conclusion that the spectral patterns of these fibers are all distinguishably different from one another. Note this is specifically true for the radiocarbon fibers and the non-image fibers from the bulk of the cloth, thereby demonstrating that the area selected for the radiocarbon sampling is atypical and is not clearly representative of the rest of the Shroud."

**Body image is not paint:** "Note, there is no evidence of the typical amide pattern (1695-1630) associated with proteins on any of these foregoing fibers; specifically, not on the image fibers, nor on the radiocarbon fibers. However, this amide pattern is clearly seen in the serum fiber samples (complex pattern 1694-1566) and in the blood samples. This is in complete agreement with the previously published chemical investigation" and does not support the painting hypothesis."

...

"These new findings support previous conclusions that the body image chromophore is an oxidation product of the cellulose itself and that the blood images are derived from clotted blood wounds.  They do not support the painting hypothesis.  The microdetection of artist's materials in the debris might seem to support the painting hypothesis. However, as neither of the X-ray examinations of the whole cloth produced any evidence for the presence of mercury in the blood images at the macroscopic level, it seems more reasonable to attribute the presence of artist's materials to the historically recorded practice of sanctifying copies of this image by pressing them to the original."

**Blood is blood:** "However, these distinctive calcite peaks are clearly not evidenced in the blood globs. Therefore, the conclusion that the blood images are derived from blood clot exudates and are not mineral pigments is further confirmed."

They compared real, dried blood to the blood on the shroud, using UV light spectroscopy:  "The peak position pattern and relative overall absorbance ratio of the blue to red region of the spectrum of traumatic clot exudates sample is in excellent agreement with the previously reported spectra of Shroud blood specimens and also the spectra taken from the examination of the whole cloth blood images.25 The spectrum of the simulated mineral blood showing only two broad weak peaks at 470 and 514 nm is in complete disagreement with these previously reported spectra."

...

"These new findings support previous conclusions that the body image chromophore is an oxidation product of the cellulose itself and that the blood images are derived from clotted blood wounds."





## Chemical Modification of Cellulose.  The Possible Effects of Chemical Cleaning on Fatty Acids Incorporated in Old Textiles, 2001

James S. Chickos and Jack Uang.  Approfondimento Sindone.  https://studylib.net/doc/7379620/chemical-modification-of-cellulose.-the-possible-effects-of

"In order to simulate a 12th century age in a relic of approximately 2000 yrs, approximately  70%  of  the  original  carbon  of  the  relic  would  have  to  be  exchanged  with “modern” carbon in the absence of some remarkable  C12/C14 fractionation.  This amount varies depending on the date or dates the exchange took place and is so significant that it is questionable that the integrity of any fabric could survive the process"

"The weight of the samples  were found to weigh roughly twice what they should according to size and measured weight of the shroud itself (11 - some italian book in 1996)"

But that doesn't add up.  See this thread:  https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/08/the-length-and-width-of-it/

 437x111 = 48507cm3.  piece taken was 7cm^3. 1100g * 7/48507 = 164mg
"Three samples, each ~50 mg in weight, were prepared from this strip."  That's 150mg which is fairly close.

"The  conditions  for cleaning used by the Oxford group were the most vigorous, 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH at 80°C (2 hours)  (1).  Although  these  conditions  should  be  sufficient  to  remove  such groups,  the  rate  of removal of these groups could be significantly affected by the hydrophobicity of the fibers in the medium."

#### Acid didn't remove the wax:

"Differences in the carbon and hydrogen  content  before  and  after  treatment  with  HCl  are -1.18+-0.9 % and -0.13 +-0.25  %. Both  the  carbon  and  hydrogen  analyses  are  within  two  standard  deviations  of  the  experimental error.   We conclude that the HCl treatment had no significant affect on the carbon and hydrogen content.  This means that HCl treatment did not remove a significant amount of the long carbon chains as far as we could tell."

The  linen  treated  with  beeswax, also appears to  have  incorporated  some  of  the  beeswax although  the  levels  are  quite  low.  Treatment  with  base  using  the  more  vigorous Oxford conditions however restored the carbon analysis to that expected for pure cellulose. As with the experiments  with  the  egg  white,  it  was  not  determined  whether  the  beeswax  was  physically  or chemically attached."


"In  conclusion,  this  work has demonstrated  that if lipids  become chemically attached to cellulose, it is quite unlikely that the chemical treatment presently used would remove all of the chemically attached groups."

Scientific Method Applied to the Shroud of Turin: A Review, 2002
----------------------------------------------------------------

Raymond N. Rogers and Anna Arnoldi. Where was this originally published?
https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers2.pdf

==TODO Read all of this==

This is 35 pages and I haven't read most of it. The authors make three main points:

1.  "The radiocarbon age determination made in 1988 used an invalid sample, and it gave an erroneous date for the production of the main part of the cloth."
    
2.  "The hypotheses that have appeared since the announcement of an AD 1260-1390 date that invoke radiation of different kinds to explain the image and the date can be categorically discarded."
    
3.  "The characteristics of the image can be explained by reference to highly probable, well-known chemical reactions. No miracles are necessary to explain the image."

"Raes thread \#1 (figure 17) shows distinct encrustation and color on one end,
but the other end is nearly white. The photograph was taken on a 50% gray card
for color comparison. Fibers have popped out of the central part of the thread,
and the fibers from the two ends point in opposite directions. This section of
yarn is obviously an end-to-end splice of two different batches of yarn. No
splices of this type were observed in the main part of the Shroud."

"When viewed in parallel light under a microscope, a scorched fiber is colored through its entire diameter, and the medulla [innermost part] usually appears to be darker than the mass of the fiber as a result of reactions at its surface and its shorter radius of curvature (figure 7)."

"The color density seen in any area of the image appears primarily to be a function of the number of colored fibers per unit area rather than a significant difference in the density of the color of the fibers.  This observation was puzzling, and we called it the 'half-tone' effect."

Textile Evidence Supports Skewed Radiocarbon Date of Shroud of Turin, 2002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

M. Sue Benford and Joseph G. Marino. Doesn't seem to be published in a journal.  https://shroud.com/pdfs/textevid.pdf

**All-star review:**  "This paper was critiqued by many of the world-renowned radiocarbon experts involved in the 1988 dating of the Shroud. Included in the review process were: Dr. Timothy Jull, Editor of the journal Radiocarbon; Harry Gove, IsoTrace Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Toronto; Paul E. Damon, University of Arizona radiocarbon laboratory; Jacques Evin, Centre de Datation par le Radiocarbone; Gabriel Vial, Professor at Institut des Textiles de Lyon; Prof. Franco A. Testore, Torino, Italy; textile expert Mechtild Fluery-Lemberg; archaeologists, William Meacham and Paul Maloney (3); and former STURP member and chemist Dr. Ray Rogers (4, 5). Dr. Rogers has in his possession both main Shroud and Raes sample threads, which enabled him to test the hypothesis posited in the paper."

**Unauthorized C14 date.**

"In 1982 an unauthorized Carbon-14 dating test was conducted on a single thread from the Raes sample. The experimental thread was provided by Dr. Alan Adler and given to Dr. John Heller. At the time, Adler was unaware that an agreement had been signed by STURP members not to do further testing on Shroud samples. Heller delivered the thread to the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) for dating by world renowned mineralogist Dr. George R. Rossman. Adler informed Rossman that one end of the thread contained, what appeared to be, a “starch contaminate.” Thus, Rossman cut the thread in half and, using what Adler described as Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTMS), dated each end of the thread separately."

"Rossman found that the non-contaminated end of the thread dated to 200 AD while the starched end dated to 1200 AD. Although Rossman did not publish these data, Adler had confidence in his capabilities to accurately measure the age of the sample.  Adler stated that Rossman is the “world’s expert in it and there’s no arguing with him . . . if he says these are the dates he got . . .” (10) In a personal conversation with one of the authors (Benford), Rossman confirmed that he was, indeed, the person who carried out the 1982 C-14 testing on the Raes thread provided by Adler."

**Blind review by three textile experts:** " Second, the paper reported the 2 results of three blinded reviews of photographs of the uncut C-14 sample, and one of the sub samples, by independent textile experts. All of the experts reported seeing what appeared to be aberrant weaving on one side of the sample."

**The Ratio of repaired vs Original Cloth match date discrepancies between the three labs**

"Finally, a review of the statistical analysis of the dates obtained by each of the three AMS Labs, as they relate to the sample’s distance to the edge of the cloth, was shown to produce a nearly identical angle as the observable angle delineating the two disparate weave patterns in the C-14 sample."

**Gove says they calculated the ratio of ancient vs medieval material wrong:**

**Vial and Testore say they were careful not to cut a patch.** "Vial and Testore declare, “We carefully inspected the shroud and we are sure that this sampling place was representing the whole shroud.” (Vial) “I examined carefully the cloth all along the warp and filling of the threads concerned, without noticing any splicing.” (Testore)"

**Jull says portion analysis is incorrect:**  

This assumes several things, including that the radiocarbon labs homogenized the entire sample they received. Further, Gove indicates the calculation given by Mr. Hatfield is incorrect and in any case, this calculation is based on an unprovable hypothesis.

**Other reviewers said they removed the patch before dating:**  "Several reviewers (Damon, Evin, Testore, Vial) state that the added piece of cloth on one side of the Shroud was clearly visible and avoided. This is stated most clearly by Testore, who writes, ‘the carbon samples represented the bulk of the Shroud and the hypothesis based on the influence of repairs on the datation has no fundament [sic]"



**Bias in publishing**

Joe Marino comments that he submitted his paper to RadioCarbon, and all of the
reviewers chosen were people involved in the 1988 C14 dating who would've looked
bad if his results were right.  One reviewer even responded,

"The authors, who, for several reasons, are convinced that the shroud is
authentic, want to publish an article in Radiocarbon only to introduce a doubt
about the dating. All people involved in the sampling and in laboratory
analyses, will be very angry with these suspicions turning on so an important
mistake or a misconduct."  https://shroudstory.com/page/1/?s=jull

 

 

## Frequently Asked Questions. 2004

Ray Rogers.  https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers5faqs.pdf

"Neither aloes or myrrh could be detected on the cloth."

==TODO== I need to read all of this.

Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the Shroud of Turin, 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------

Raymond Rogers. Thermochimica Acta http://www.shroud.it/ROGERS-3.PDF

"Pyrolysis-mass-spectrometry results from the sample area coupled with
microscopic and microchemical observations prove that the radiocarbon sample was
not part of the original cloth of the Shroud of Turin. The radiocarbon date was
thus not valid for determining the true age of the shroud."

"the [1988 C14 sampling] operation was done in secrecy, and no chemical
investigations were made at the time to characterize the sample."

### Samples

"I received 14 yarn segments from the Raes sample from Prof. Luigi Gonella
(Department of Physics, Turin Polytechnic University) on 14 October 1979."

"On 12 December 2003, I received samples of both warp and weft threads that
Prof. Luigi Gonella had taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was
distributed for dating. Gonella reported that he excised the threads from the
center of the radiocarbon sample."

### Vanillin Test

"The Raes threads, the Holland cloth, and all other medieval linens gave the
test for vanillin wherever lignin could be observed on growth nodes."

Rogers provides calculations for rates of vanillin loss from lignin. ctrl+f
"Arrhenius expression"

"If the shroud had been stored at a constant 25 ◦C, it would have taken about
1319 years to lose a conservative 95% of its vanillin. At 23 ◦C, it would have
taken about 1845 years. At 20 ◦C, it would take about 3095 years. If the shroud
had been produced between a.d. 1260 and 1390, as indicated by the radiocarbon
analyses, lignin should be easy to detect. A linen produced in a.d. 1260 would
have retained about 37% of its vanillin in 1978. The fire of 1532 could not have
greatly affected the vanillin content of lignin in all parts of the shroud
equally. The thermal conductivity of linen is very low, 2.1 × 10−4 cal cm−1 s−1
◦C−1; therefore, the unscorched parts of the folded cloth could not have become
very hot. The temperature gradient through the cloth in the reliquary should
have been very steep, and the cloth’s center would not have heated at all in the
time available. The rapid change in color from black to white at the margins of
the scorches illustrates this fact. Any heating at the time of the fire would
decrease the amount of vanillin in the lignin as a function of the temperature
and time heated; however, different amounts of vanillin would have been lost in
different areas. No samples from any location on the shroud gave the vanillin
test. Because the shroud and other very old linens do not give the vanillin
test, the cloth must be quite old. It is thus very unlikely that the linen was
produced during medieval times."

"The fact that vanillin can not be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead
Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicates that the shroud is quite
old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggests that the shroud
is between 1300- and 3000-years old. Even allowing for errors in the
measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to
be as young as 840 years."

### Radiocarbon sample contains cotton and dye not on main cloth

"Raes found that one part of his sample contained cotton, but the part on the
other side of a seam did not. He reported that the cotton was an ancient Near
Eastern variety, Gossypium herbaceum, on the basis of the distance between
reversals in the tape-shaped fibers."

"All threads from the Raes sample and the yarn segments from the radiocarbon
sample show colored encrustations (or coatings) on their surfaces (Figs. 2 and
3). The coating material is not removed by nonpolar solvents, but it swells and
dissolves in water. There was absolutely no coating with these characteristics
on either the Holland cloth or the main part of the shroud. When Raes and
radiocarbon-sample threads were teased open at both ends with a dissecting
needle, the cores appeared to be colorless, suggesting the color and its vehicle
were added by wiping a viscous liquid on the outside of the yarn. A marked
difference between inside and outside fibers is characteristic of both the Raes
and radiocarbon samples. The yellow–brown coating on the outside of the
radiocarbon warp sample is so heavy that it looks black by transmitted light
(Fig. 2)

"The radiocarbon sample contains both a gum/dye/mordant coating and cotton
fibers. The main part of the shroud does not contain these materials."

"Adler, Selzer, and DeBlase... reported concentrations of aluminum on the
radiocarbon sample 20-times those on shroud fibers... **(TODO find that
soruce)** The presence of alizarin dye and red lakes in the Raes and radiocarbon
samples indicates that the color has been manipulated. Specifically, the color
and distribution of the coating implies that repairs were made at an unknown
time with foreign linen dyed to match the older original material... The
consequence of this conclusion is that the radiocarbon sample was not
representative of the original cloth."

"The gum coating was quickly hydrolyzed by either concentrated HCl or 2N NaOH."

"the gum coating on the Raes and radiocarbon samples is a pentosan [a plant
gum]. None can be detected on any fibers from the main part of the shroud."

### Summary of Dye Evidence

"A gum/dye/mordant coating is easy to observe on Raes and radiocarbon yarns. No
other part of the shroud shows such a coating. The early thermal evolution of
furfural during pyrolysis/ms analyses, the relatively easy water solubility, the
yellow color formed with iodine, and the easy hydrolysis suggest gum Arabic. Gum
Arabic is obtained from Acacia senegal and is composed of pentose-sugar units.
Its presence as a major component in the coatings on the Raes and radiocarbon
samples is not a surprise, because it has long been a common vehicle in tempera
paints. The radiocarbon sample had been dyed. Dyeing was probably done
intentionally on pristine replacement material to match the color of the older,
sepia-colored cloth. The gum is probably the same age as the Raes and
radiocarbon yarn and should have no effect on the age determination. In any
case, this watersoluble, easily-hydrolyzed gum would have been removed
completely by the cleaning procedures used on the dated samples [1]. The dye
found on the radiocarbon sample was not used in Europe before about a.d. 1291
and was not common until more than 100 years later. **The combined evidence from
chemical kinetics, analytical chemistry, cotton content, and pyrolysis/ms proves
that the material from the radiocarbon area of the shroud is significantly
different from that of the main cloth. The radiocarbon sample was thus not part
of the original cloth and is invalid for determining the age of the shroud**."

### Blood spots have animal protein

"pyrolysis/ms spectra of samples from apparent blood spots showed hydroxyproline
peaks at mass 131, a pyrolysis product of animal proteins."

### TODO

Check these sources 2 & 3: "However, that date does not agree with observations
on the linen-production technology nor the chemistry of fibers obtained directly
from the main part of the cloth in 1978 [2,3]"

It would be good to make a javascript calculator to see how much a high
temperature for an hour could age the vanillin.

### Main Points

1.  The shroud has no vanillin like other ancient cloths, unlike the Raes
    threads, the backing cloth, and other cloths from medieval times.

2.  "The fire of 1532 could not have greatly affected the vanillin content of
    lignin in all parts of the shroud equally."

3.  "A gum/dye/mordant coating is easy to observe on Raes and radiocarbon yarns.
    No other part of the shroud shows such a coating."

4.  "The dye found on the radiocarbon sample was not used in Europe before about
    a.d. 1291 and was not common until more than 100 years later."

5.  "The radiocarbon sample was thus not part of the original cloth and is
    invalid for determining the age of the shroud."

Microscopical Investigation of Selected Raes Threads from the Shroud of Turin, 2005.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

John L. Brown. https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/brown1.pdf

Found gum/mordant/dye coating on fibers:

> The author, as a microscopist, has had an opportunity to examine some of the Raes threads. Figure 1 shows a weft [horizontal] thread, R7, at an original magnification of 28X. The thread has a yellow-brown coating with the exception of indented regions which are white. These indented regions are at the intersection with the warp [vertical] thread. The weave was tight enough that
> the application of a relatively viscous gum/mordant/dye solution did not penetrate the intersection of the threads. **This would appear to be obvious evidence of a medieval artisan’s attempt to dye a newly added repair region of fabric to match the aged appearance of the remainder of the Shroud.** Figure 2 shows the same thread at 56X magnification. The coating and encrustations can be seen on individual fibers.

Raes found cotton.  Does Brown mean that there's tin amounts of cotton throughout the Shroud, yet more cotton on the Raes sample?

> Raes found that the samples contained cotton within the linen threads. Only traces of cotton are found on the Shroud.

Brown also found cotton:

> The cotton fibers found by previous investigators are evident during examination of thread R14 in a stereomicroscope at 100X magnification. Cotton can be identified by its tape-like structure and frequent sharp bends. 

> Chemical elements such as C, O, Cl, K and Ca have been detected in the coating, but complete analysis is still an ongoing project.

## Ghiberti's pronouncement on my analyses.  2005.

http://www.sindone.info/ROGERS-5.PDF

"It is interesting that Msgr. Ghiberti thinks I am supporting the Benford and Marino hypothesis that the radiocarbon sample was taken from an 'invisible reweave.' Much to the contrary: I believed that it would be easy to completely refute them. It is highly embarrassing that I could not. This is the first time I have had to present information that seemed to support what I consider to be the 'lunatic fringe.' However, an ethical scientist absolutely must publish accurate information no matter what the emotional implications."

"I received some of the 1973 Raes threads from Luigi Gonella on 14 October 1979. If they were spurious, a person I consider to be a good scientist, Luigi, lied to me. The fact that they agreed with Raes' observations seems to confirm their validity. Their location on the Shroud shows that they must share at least some yarn segments with the radiocarbon sample. They proved to my satisfaction that the radiocarbon sample was spurious. I then received samples of the authentic radiocarbon sample on 12 December 2003. Their composition was identical to that of the Raes threads, proving the relationship between the samples. AM*STAR received the authentic radiocarbon samples from Luigi. Unless he lied again, they are authentic samples. The fact that they show identical compositions to the Raes samples seems to confirm their provenience. Incidentally, I am not a member of AM*STAR, they did not fund my work, and they did not have any control over my methods or conclusions. I also have many fibers from different parts of the Shroud and the Holland cloth that I took with adhesive tape in 1978. I marked them in Turin, and I know they are authentic."

**UV photographs show a difference:** "Msgr. Ghiberti does not have to rely on my chemistry to observe a difference between the radiocarbon sample and the main part of the Shroud. He can look at the ultraviolet fluorescence photographs taken by Vern Miller in 1978. They show the sampling area as a dark zone, proving that its chemical composition was not the same as the main cloth. The dark area is not a result of dirt or a shadow. I can explain fluorescence in great detail, but it is based totally on chemical composition."

**End to end splice:** "I did find a strange end-to-end splice among the Raes threads (macrophotograph and photomicrograph attached). Anna Maria Donadoni, a conservator in Turin, showed me how separate lengths of yarn were overlaid in weaving the main Shroud cloth. The splice is totally different. It is also obvious that the two ends of the splice are different: one is fluffy and white, the other is stained and tightly twisted"

## A Skeptical Response to Studies on the Radiocarbon Sample from the Shroud of Turin.   2005

https://web.archive.org/web/20170212064305/http://llanoestacado.org/freeinquiry/skeptic/shroud/articles/rogers-ta-response.htm

This article is cited by wikipedia, and is so comically over the top to be useless.  Largely devoid of useful content.  Here are some of the funny statements:

1. "Ray Rogers is a member of STURP (Shroud of Turin Research Project, an organization totally composed of believers in the authenticity of the Shroud) and accepted the authenticity of the Shroud from the very beginning of their work in the middle 1970s."
2. "There is no real blood of any kind on the Shroud. Both the image and "blood" were applied by an artist. These facts were conclusively proved beyond even a shadow of doubt by microscopic chemist Walter McCrone, whose microscopic analysis revealed the presence of abundant iron oxide (red ocher) and cinnabar (vermilion) pigments on the Shroud."
3. "In brief, every competent and honest scientific investigation of the Shroud of Turin has proven that it is a medieval artifact, a reproduction or representation of the Shroud of Jesus Christ (not a medieval fake, but a 1st century fake!)."

I  stopped reading at "Rogers identification of a colored "dye" is the first admission by a STURP member that fibers of the Shroud have been painted or coated--which is certainly the case." because I think it's a waste of time.

So far he makes his case by saying Rogers is lying about how he got his samples, and citing McCrone.

## Radiological Aspects of the Shroud of Turin.  2005.

https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/whanger.pdf

**15,000 threads from the side strip line up with the shroud:** " A joint paper, “Concerning the Side Strip on the Shroud of Turin,” (Ref.: Adler et al, 1997) was presented at the May 1997 Nice Symposium in which we reported our findings from tracing several thousand of some 15,000 weft threads from the body of the Shroud through the seam and into the side strip that there is near-perfect alignment of nearly each thread in position, thickness, and intensity. Also, we found no evidence of frayed thread ends either in the seam or along either side of it. Our conclusion then was that the side strip is continuous with the rest of the Shroud."

"The weft threads can be traced from the Shroud through the seam continuing into the side strip in near perfect alignment. The seam appears to be a simple tuck (a portion of the cloth folded over on itself) in the Shroud fabric, which is meticulously hand-sewed in place on both sides of the tuck."

**Bottom left corner doesn't line up well with the side seam:**  "(Figures 8) As the seam approaches each of the MC [missing corner] areas, it becomes irregular, more dense, and harder to interpret, possibly becoming a rolled seam. On the frontal end, this change begins about 1/3 inch (1.5 cm) above (cephalad, or toward the head) the junction of the end of the side strip at the MC. Variations in the radiodensity of the various bands of the Shroud fabric are noted. Various wrinkles and folds can be seen as well. The area where the Raes sample fabric was taken in 1973 can be seen extending distally from the tip of the seam. (Figures 9 & 10) This is an irregular band of threads with increased radiodensity immediately adjacent to much of the length of the seam that borders the MC, extending variably out about 5/8 inch (1.7 cm) into the Shroud fabric"

"The weave pattern in the side strip in this small area is irregular and some of the herringbone pattern is apparently lost, both in the body of the Shroud and in the side strip. The damage in the dorsal MC area appears more significant and the repairs less well done than in the frontal MC area. Some small folds contribute to the problem of interpretation."

**Repair on the top right is more obvious:** "(Figure 11) On the dorsal side, the irregular changes in the seam begin about 1¼ inch (3 cm) above the junction of the side strip with the MC [missing corner] . It is much more difficult to trace the weft threads through the seam and the stitch pattern is unclear, but some whip stitches may have been used. There is definite increase in the radiodensity of some both warp and weft threads extending variably both into the body of the Shroud and the side strip for about 3/8 to 5/8 inch (1.5 to 1.7 cm) extending distally from the point where the structure of the seam changes. (Figure 12) The weave pattern in the side strip in this small area is irregular and some of the herringbone pattern is apparently lost, both in the body of the Shroud and in the side strip. The damage in the dorsal MC area appears more significant and the repairs less well done than in the frontal MC area. Some small folds contribute to the problem of interpretation."

**Side Seam added after repairs:** "We think that the two corners (the MC [missing corner]  areas) were already damaged and possibly partially missing before the seam was put in. They may have been removed at the time the seam was put in as part of the process of repairing and strengthening the Shroud, and to make the areas neater (as well as to provide a source of relics). We suspect that the corners were damaged during ostensions (public displays) when the Shroud was always held up by the same edge, thus putting stress on the same side and especially on the corners. The fabric immediately adjacent to the two MC areas likely was damaged or weakened also, and so meticulous repair and reweaving of these areas may have been done to restore the general appearance and to prevent further damage. Our observations of the radiographs indicate that possible repairs or reweaving (other than the stitches and patches around the scorched and burned areas) were essentially limited to these two corner areas next to the sites of the MCs."

"We speculate that the fabric repair and the creation of the seam were done at the same time, after which the Holland backing cloth was attached. We marvel at the extraordinary skill, care, and patience that were manifested during the process by those doing the work."

**1988 video  of cutting C14 samle shows very stiff weft threads, indicating repair:** "we obtained a copy of the videotape of the taking of the single specimen. (Figures 15 & 16) On examining the videotape in detail frame by frame, we noted that the sample contained the seam and that, as the sample was pulled taut and cut, there were many weft threads that stood out very prominently from the seam extending across the sample used for the radiocarbon dating and into the Shroud fabric as far as 1½ inches (3.5 cm). These threads appeared to be very stiff, and it occurred to us immediately that this area had been rewoven, repaired, or reinforced."

Their figures 15 and 16 are blurry and I don't see anything obvious enough to build and argument from here.

**C14 corner has some weave looks broken, irregularity in thread density:**

"(Figure 17) To help clarify this issue, we examined in detail the area of the C14 specimen on the radiographs. An irregular band of threads with increased radiodensity and extending variably about 5/8 inch (1.7 cm) into the Shroud fabric is noted immediately adjacent to much of the length of the seam that borders the frontal MC. In a close-up view of the area where the Raes sample and the single C14 sample were taken, irregularities in some of the weave pattern can be noted on the Shroud fabric adjacent to the seam. (Figure 18) There is significant variability in the radiodensity of both warp and weft threads in this area. Some of the threads angulate, and the continuity of a few seems to be broken. This area is denser and the 3:1 herringbone weave pattern is much less obvious than in the nearby body of the Shroud fabric."

"Our conclusion is that the radiographs are strongly suggestive of significant alterations in the threads and weave of the Shroud fabric in the area from which the C14 specimen was taken, thus casting major doubts on the validity of the radiocarbon dating."

However, I'm not able to see what they're talking about in figures 17 and 18.

**Alan Adler's carbon dated thread:** "A very interesting finding is that a single weft thread has been extracted at about the midway level of where the Raes sample was removed, beginning about 1 cm medial to the rolled seam that reattached the Shroud to the backing cloth. The space of the missing thread appears to be about 8 cm in length. We do not know the history of this particular thread, but Dr. Alan Adler had a thread about 8 cm in length that came from the Shroud that he acquired in the early 1980s from an unidentified source. He detected what he referred to as starch on one end of this thread. He then had a very unofficial and admittedly inadequate radiocarbon dating done on each end of this thread in 1983. Reportedly, the starched end tested about AD 1000 and the other end of the same thread tested about AD 200. At a minimum, this would indicate that carbon dating the Shroud might be very technically problematic. Assuming that the thread that Dr. Adler had might have been the one that had been extracted at this site, we may have a highly significant, even if inadequate, finding, since the lateral 1 to 2 cm of this thread would have been in the continuation of the area from which the 1988 specimen was extracted. If this scenario is correct, we may not only have evidence that the 1988 sample-extraction-area is abnormal, but we may also have a much more accurate dating of the body of the Shroud, namely, in the range of AD 200."

**Body image can't be seen in x-rays:**  "We were interested as to whether any of the body images could be detected on the radiographs. The radiographs were placed on a panel of light boxes in a University Department of Radiology and examined by a faculty radiologist in my presence. He and I concurred with the original observation by Mottern et al (Ref.: Mottern et al, 1979) that none of the body images could be discerned."

The Invisible Mending of the Shroud, the Theory and the Reality, 2007
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Mechthild Flury-Lemberg. BSTS. 2007. http://shroud.com/pdfs/n65part5.pdf

### Main points:

1.  Patching the cloth with new horizontal and vertical threads could only be
    done invisibly on the front, not the back.

2.  If the vertical (warp) threads are preserved, cloth can be invisibly
    repaired on both sides. But this can only be done with the course threads of
    something like a tapestry. Fine fabric doesn't allow hiding extra threads.

3.  Any repair made with the naked eye would be visible to the naked eye.

4.  The Shroud linen is likely in better shape because it was never buried like
    other ancient linens.

5.  The quad mosaic (infrared) images show a discoloration at the radiocarbon
    corner, but without a clear outline expected from a repair. This is likely
    due to greasy dirt on that corner, not having its origins in rewoven yarn.

6.  There's enough greasy dirt to throw off the C14 date.

### Quotes

"If the colour and the quality of the new weft threads are a perfect match for the original weft [horizontal] threads the operation is indeed **invisible on the front**, still it is always **clearly recognizable on the back** by the newly inserted warp threads. If the warp [vertical] threads have been preserved in a damaged area (which makes the insertion of new warp threads unnecessary), the operation is **invisible on both sides** of the textile and one can rightly call it "invisible inweaving." This kind of technical proceeding applicable exclusively to the coarse weaving structure of a tapestry. A completely different procedure is required for the repair of a delicate fabric. The fineness of its threads and the resulting delicate, dense structure don't allow for the hiding of the added threads needed for repair." (bold is original)

"There is no method to make a hole of 1 square centimetre disappear in this type
of delicate fabric. It is of course feasible to restore the missing part,
imitating exactly the weaving structure of the original, as has been described
for the first example.  This method is called today invisible mending, and
threads from the original are used in the process.  But even the most successful
execution can ultimately not conceal the operation completely to the trained
eye, and it will always be **unequivocally visible on the reverse** of the
fabric."

"As these repairs have been executed with the naked eye, they can also be recognized without a magnifying glass by the trained eye!"

Attaching the Dutch Holland Cloth and course darning some patched areas with brown yarn "were the only historical stitching done on the shroud."

"The linen shroud has never been buried in the ground. Its exceptionally good condition is in no way comparable to other shrouds which have spent hundreds of years in graves."

"The infrared pictures show a diffuse discoloration at the corner in question, i.e. a discoloration without the definite outlines of an allegedly mended area. A darn would have to appear in the picture as clearly defined."

"Furthermore the discoloured spot in the infrared picture is so big that it could not possibly be the location of a darn which had not previously been detected by the naked eye."

"If looked at without a magnifying glass... the area around the removed sample
and the preserved corners display discolorations as big as human palms: blackish
deposits under which the fibres appear to be sticking together. These coatings -
obvious to the naked eye - are clearly in contrast to the surface of the rest of
the shroud, fig.15. But they do not have their origins in added yarns used in
darning or inweaving, as has been postulated, they are simply greasy dirt."

"The presence of the greasy dirt deposit at the "removal site" alone would be
sufficient to demonstrate the uselessness of the carbon-14 method, without
having to construct an untenable "mending theory".

 

## Analytical Results On Thread Samples Taken From The Raes Sampling Area (Corner) Of The Shroud Cloth, 2007

Robert Villarreal, Barrie Schwortz, M. Sue Benford.

Villarreal was a chemist who worked for Los Alamos National Laboratory.  [He was Catholic.](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/lamonitor/obituary.aspx?n=roberto-villarreal-bobby&pid=188454305)

Shroud Science Group International Conference.

"I became involved with the analytical aspect of the Shroud when Ray Rogers asked me for help in conducting certain Shroud image formation studies.  He needed an alpha-particle source to complete investigation of possible image formation processes and some radiochemical calculations on the depth of penetration of an emitted alpha-particle into flax fibers. "

"Before I was able to give him the above compilation, Ray passed away.  Ray repeatedly asserted to me that he was not concerned whether the Shroud was or was not the burial shroud of Jesus, but if a determination was to be made, it must be scientifically correct."

"After his death, I asked Joan, Ray’s wife, what I should do with the thread sample he had given me for analyses and she said to hold on to it.  About 18 months later, I received a call from Barrie Schwortz inquiring if I had the “spliced thread.”  I asked him if I should proceed to arrange to conduct analyses on the thread with the above instruments and he encouraged me to continue.  After conducting analysis at high vacuum with the ToF-SIMS, the “spliced thread” broke into three distinct pieces; a fuzzy end (Region 1), a tight woven end (Region 2), and a micro-sized circular cocoon-shaped brown crust that seemed to be connecting the two end pieces.  The ToF-SIMS results were the first to show that the spectra from the two ends were similar to cotton rather than linen (flax) and the Spectroscopist recommended that the next analysis should be with the FTIR instrument.  After several scans of individual fibers or strands, the FTIR data showed that the two ends (Region 1 and 2) were definitely cotton and not linen (flax).  The crust appeared to be an organic-based resin, perhaps a terpene species, with cotton as a main sub-component.  After showing the FTIR data to Barrie Schwortz and Sue Benford, they were quite surprised at the results and decided to send me two other pieces of thread (No. 7 and 14) that were from the same sampling area and that had been in John Brown’s Lab in Marrietta, Georgia."

"The results of the FTIR analysis on all three threads taken from the Raes sampling area (adjacent to the C-14 sampling corner) led to identification of the fibers as cotton and definitely not linen (flax). "

Discrepancies in the radiocarbon dating area of the Turin Shroud, 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------------

M. Sue Benford and Joseph G. Marino. Chemistry Today.  (Chemistry Today is a peer reviewed journal)
http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/benfordmarino2008.pdf

"Raes found that the side seam had been attached to the adjacent main Shroud by
a 2-ply-linen sewing thread. By removing the sewing thread, Raes was able to
separate his sample into two distinct pieces, which he identified as “Piece 1”
and “Piece 2.” Each piece exhibits different characteristics, such as cotton
content, lignan content at the growth nodes, and thread size, suggesting two
different origins of the yarns (Figure 7)." (But in his 1991 paper, Raes was
unsure whether Piece 1 & 2 came from the same or different cloths.) Raes's Piece
2 is part of the strip sewn to the side of the whole Shroud.

"Flury-Lemberg makes an important observation about the side seam and adjacent
stitches. “The sewing has been done from the reverse of the fabric and the
stitches have been executed with great care and are barely noticeable on the
face of the Shroud” (20)." (keep in mind this is the side seam, not the patched
region)

"Both the exposed Holland cloth and the adjacent radiocarbon sample area are a
uniform dark-green colour... Similar solid geometric patterns with defined
borders in this hue are not observable elsewhere on the cloth (see Figure 3)."

"The Quad-Mosaic images [high resolution, multi-spectrum photos], radiographic
[x-ray] findings, textile evidence from the adjacent Raes sample, blinded-expert
analysis of the Zurich C-14 sub-sample, and independent microscopic confirmation
of surface contaminates in the Holland cloth/C-14 region supports Rogers’
assertion that a surface dye was added to the Shroud in the area of the 1988
radiocarbon sampling to disguise an undocumented repair. These data further
confirm that this substance included the exposed Holland cloth on the ventral,
but not dorsal, side of the cloth. Thus, the application of this substance
occurred sometime after the Holland backing cloth was attached to the Shroud in
AD 1534 and prior to the 1973 Raes sample extraction but was intentionally added
to only one side of the cloth. These data further support the theory that the
radiocarbon sampling area was manipulated during or after the 16th Century."

"The most probable scenario is that the original smaller section of Holland
cloth was extracted for relics. This section was most likely replaced with newer
material that did not match the exposed dorsal section of Holland cloth. Also
consistent with the data is the hypothesis that the person(s) responsible for
taking this section of Holland cloth also extracted a small section of main
Shroud cloth directly adjacent to the side seam and missing ventral corner,
e.g., the C-14 sampling area (see Figure 13; additional details available in
reference 2). To hide the extraction, the missing material would have been
patched and surfaced dyed, along with the newer backing material, such that it
would not have been detected. Starch, which was identified in this area, was
routinely used by medieval restorers to disguise invisible mending."

"Historical evidence demonstrates that it was not only possible for medieval
weavers and embroiderers to invisibly mend textiles such that they were not
top-side detectable, but it is also recognized that they could choose whether or
not to permit their handiwork from being detected on the back side as well."

From source 28: "Historically, reweaving was not carried out through a support
fabric and was often executed so skilfully that it is not always recognizable as
a later addition, although differences in the rate of dye fading have often
revealed its presence."

From source 30: "Depending on the size and condition of the damaged area, and
the fabric to be worked on, one of the following methods is applied: FRENCH
WEAVE - also known as the Invisible Weave, this technique is done on select
fabrics with small tears, holes and burns. Individual thread strands from hidden
areas, such as a cuff or inseam, are actually woven together by hand. This
creates new fabric as it closes the hole and the repair is virtually
indistinguishable from the surrounding fabric […] INWEAVING - For larger tears,
and when the French weave is not practical. The weaver cuts a patch of hidden
fabric and places it over the damaged area, matching the fabric’s pattern. The
frayed edges are then hand woven into the material. The edges of the repair are
invisible to the eye"

"In the “In Weaving” technique described above, it is important to note that
there is a requisite overlap and intermixing between the newer patch material
and the existing textile via the integration of frayed edges into the damaged
textile and vice versa. The unavoidable interweaving required of this invisible
mending technique would, most assuredly, have created heterogeneity in the C-14
sample area"

"a sample containing \~ 67 percent cal AD 1500 radiocarbon and \~ 33 percent cal
[C14 calibrated] AD [appears to be a typo--from context should be "cal AD 75"]
should yield a calibrated date of \~ cal AD 1210"

"Since the [C14] sample does not show any evidence of a water stain marking,
this could very well be explained by the later addition of a patch in this
area."

"the entire C-14 sample area was outside the water stain region."

"Further, it is also notable that the reserve sample (Figure 16) **does not
appear to have any water stain markings**. According to the illustration of the
water stain area, the stain should have gone directly through the mid-section of
the reserve sample forming a distinct marking discoloration. Since the sample
does not show any evidence of a water stain marking, this could very well be
explained by the later addition of a patch in this area."

### TODO

I need to describe the evidence for each item in this quote: "The Quad-Mosaic
images [high resolution, multi-spectrum photos], radiographic [x-ray] findings,
textile evidence from the adjacent Raes sample, blinded-expert analysis of the
Zurich C-14 sub-sample, and independent microscopic confirmation of surface
contaminates in the Holland cloth/C-14 region supports Rogers’ assertion that a
surface dye was added to the Shroud in the area of the 1988 radiocarbon
sampling"

### Main Points

There are 5 evidences supporting the repair hypothesis. Figure 1 is a good map
of the RAES fragment and regions taken from the cloth for the different C14
laboratories.

-   The Quad-Mosaic images show that the background Holland Cloth and the
    radiocarbon sample area next to it are "a uniform dark-green colour."
    "Similar solid geometric patterns with defined borders in this hue are not
    observable elsewhere on the cloth (see Figure 3)."

-   "skilful medieval weavers could choose whether or not to leave evidence of
    their work on the back side of a fabric." (quotes another source, context is
    iffy)

-   TODO: radiographic x-rays

-   TODO: textile evidence from Raes sample

-   TODO: blind-expert analysis (From Marino 2000)

-   TODO: microscopic confirmations

 

The Right Date for the Wrong Part of the Shroud of Turin, 2008
--------------------------------------------------------------

William David Cline.
http://ir-lib.wilmina.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10775/76/1/04.pdf

The paper is about various shenanigans with the C14 dating and argues for the
repair hypothesis, mostly from what's **already stated in other papers**. It
also looks like it's not peer-reviewed.

### Carbon Dating Shenanigans

"In 1984 results of the tests were collected and compared. Most laboratories
were in agreement on the dates except that one laboratory had a result that
differed by about 1,000 years (Gove, pp. 77-79). This error was attributed to
mistakes that were made in Bern, Switzerland while preparing the sampling carbon
(Gove, 1996, p. 91)."

"On April 21, 1988, the Shroud was taken out of its reliquary and placed on a
table for the sample to be cut. The procedure was videotaped so it is possible
to see the two people in charge of cutting the sample arguing for over an hour
about the place to cut (Case, 1996, p. 39). Contrary to recommendations that
samples be taken from different areas of the Shroud, a single sample was taken
from one corner."

"The Nature article on the Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud appeared in February.  Although standard procedure called for Nature articles to be peer reviewed, according to Guerrera, in this case, the standard procedure was not followed."

"a chemical analysis of the radiocarbon sample from the Shroud was not performed
by any of the three laboratories involved in the dating"

### Reweaving

"Flury-Lemberg stated that the cloth is the same from one end to the other.
There is no need to take samples from various places. One could take strips from
the edges of the main cloth from any place and it would be the same."

"Flury-Lemberg was head of the Textile Workshop, Abegg-Stiftung, in Bern, her
visual assessment of the Shroud was not the same as a chemical assessment.
However, her view seemed to prevail. Contrary to her view, the archaeologist,
William Meachan argued unsuccessfully for multiple samples to be taken from the
Shroud but his arguments were viewed by Gove as “remarkably inappropriate as
applied to the shroud”

"Benford and Marino... report that Madame Flury-Lemberg countered their argument
by stating that this was “technically impossible.” However, Benford and Marino
consulted a present day textile repair service, Without a Trace, and were told
by the president of the firm that normal reweaving repair is detectable on the
reverse side but that “French reweaving” is undetectable. It is extremely
expensive and takes considerable time. Benford and Marino point out that the
owners of the Shroud, the House of Savoy, had the requisite resources to make
such repairs (Benford and Marino, 2005, pp. 1-2). Benford and Marino also found
evidence of invisible repair in a 1998 book by Professor Piero Savarino, who was
the custodian of the Shroud’s scientific advisor. He co-authored a book in which
it states that invisible mending had routinely been done on the Shroud."

### Rogers praised by Critic

Raymond Roger's "reputation was such that even Harry Gove, a fierce critic of
STURP, wrote that in 1996, “I was saddened to hear that Rogers had left STURP
because he was one of the few scientists in that organization for whom I had
real respect. Rogers was a UCLA/Los Alamos Fellow, a co-founder of the Coalition
for Excellence in Science Education, a member of the Air Force Scientific
Advisory Board, and he had published over 50 peer-reviewed papers in scientific
journals."

### Rogers changed his mind

"What motivated Rogers to do the analysis is that he had read the Marino and
Benford 2000 paper with the hypothesis that a reweaving repair on the
radiocarbon dating sample area of the Shroud had introduced new materials which
gave a too recent date for the Shroud. Rogers said that when he heard about this
he considered it the last straw. Here were people untrained in chemistry, making
theories based merely on visual observations. He thought that with the materials
he had on hand, he could prove them wrong in short order. However, within an
hour he came out of his lab saying that Marino and Benford might be right after
all (Schwortz, 2008)."

### Corroboration of Reweaving Data

"Additional support for Rogers came from John L. Brown of the Georgia Institute
of Technology who examined a Raes weft thread with an electron microscope and
found a yellow-brown coating except in indented areas where the warp thread
intersected. He also found cotton fibers among the sample. (Brown, 2005, p. 2).
Most recently, Robert Villarreal of Los Alamos Laboratory presented additional
evidence confirming the work of Rogers. Villarreal was able to use High
Resolution Photo-Microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and
Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry for his analysis. First of all, a
thread sample from the Raes Corner, taken from next to the C-14 sample, showed
evidence of having been spliced. Photos of the spliced thread show a darker and
tighter spun part and a lighter colored loosely spun part on either end of the
splice. No spliced threads were found on the main body of the Shroud. On the
main body of the Shroud, where weavers came to the end of a thread, a new thread
was simply laid next to it and weaving continued. Another finding was a resin
coating on the threads. Finally, analysis of the spliced thread and other
threads from the Raes Corner identified cotton spun together with linen,
indicating that the material in that area was different than the material in the
rest of the Shroud (Villarreal, 2008 and New Findings, 2008)."

### Other arguments against medieval origin

"why would a forger go to such extensive trouble to produce the Shroud when it
was easy to make a fake relic and sell it as genuine? There are details,
invisible to the naked eye, in the blood flows and chemistry of the blood on the
Shroud that medical doctors and chemists have documented to be medically
accurate. The microscopic pollen found on the Shroud indicate an origin in
Jerusalem (Danin, Whanger, Baruch & Whanger, 1999). In addition, how would a
medieval forger know to put microscopic amounts of calcium, unique to Jerusalem,
in the areas of the feet and the knees? Also, the art of medieval Europe shows
details of the crucifixion known to be historically inaccurate that differ from
details on the Shroud which are historically accurate. Why would a forger step
out of his contemporary time frame to do this? Additionally, the method of
production of other relics can easily be determined but the image on the Shroud
has not been fully explained or replicated to this day."

Maloney 2008
------------

I haven't read this paper yet:

Textile expert Linda Eaton: "high quality re-weaving would not have knots on the
back, but it is immensely difficult, if not impossible, for it to be done so
that it remains invisible to close and careful examination, with or without a
microscope. This is not something that you can do from photographs, either, as
sometimes it is so good that you have to feel it too"

Analytical Results On Thread Samples Taken From The Raes Sampling Area (Corner) Of The Shroud Cloth, 2008
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robert Villarreal

"Ray [Rogers] repeatedly asserted to me that he was not concerned whether the
Shroud was or was not the burial shroud of Jesus, but if a determination was to
be made, it must be scientifically correct."

"After several scans of individual fibers or strands, the FTIR data showed that
the two ends (Region 1 and 2) [of Roy Roger's spliced thread] were definitely
cotton and not linen (flax)." But why would you splice cotton to cotton when
invisibly reweaving a linen cloth? Still this proves there were cotton threads
deliberately added, not just accumulated cotton fluff."

"The results of the FTIR analysis on all three threads taken from the Raes
sampling area (adjacent to the C-14 sampling corner) led to identification of
the fibers as cotton and definitely not linen (flax)."

"there are many cotton fibers in the outer part of R7. However, it must be noticed that the total number of cotton fibers (23/96=24%) is certainly an overestimation because 1) it is difficult if not impossible to count exactly the number of fibers gathered in groups 2) many of the cotton fibers are small and certainly come from long cotton fibers which had been broken (perhaps during the handling process: cotton fibers are obviously more brittle than flax fibers)."

"Another important fact is that cotton fibers were often found gathered in some locations, forming bundles or “nodes”. This may explain why in some samples there is no cotton fiber at all (R7C), while in other samples there are many cotton fibers."

"The total amount of “complete” cotton fibers in the outer part of R7 is therefore about 15%."

"It is impossible to see the cotton on the whole tight thread “as received”, even with polarized light microscopy: it is necessary to separate many fibers"

## Akeldama repudiation of Turin Shroud omits evidence from the Judean Desert.  2010.

Fulbright, Diana.  http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/fulbrightakeldamaweb.pdf

This paper counters British and Israeli archaeologists who say fragments from Akadelma tombs in Jerusalem disprove the authenticity of the shroud.

**Bigger and much older shroud from Cave of the Warrior:** "This 6,000-year-old shroud is a large, rectangular linen cloth, 7 meters (22’ 11”) long and 2 meters (6’ 6”) wide. Even though about a third of it is missing, it could still be reconstructed on the basis of surviving parts... One might think from size of the cloth that it had been assembled from several pieces. However, it was designed and manufactured as a single sheet."

"The impressive width of the cloth indicates that it was woven on a ground loom with beams of more than two meters long. This “could not have been accomplished by a single weaver, nor even by two, as often depicted in Egyptian wall paintings” [13]. Three, even four weavers would have been required, as is still practiced by Bedouin weavers. The weavers are thought to have been exceptionally experienced to have produced textiles of such high quality. Dr. Tamar Schick, author of the textiles section of the Israeli Antiquities Authority Report on this discovery, comments: “The warrior’s textiles are exceptional in size, accomplishment, refinement and state of preservation. It is, however, unlikely that they were unique in their time” [14]. In other words, she believes that it is likely there were other such exceptional textiles from the Chalcolithic period. The Turin Shroud has been disparaged by skeptics for being too large to have been produced as early as the first century. These textiles from the Cave of the Warrior, produced 6,000 years ago, absolutely nullify this objection. "

**Bigger textiles in Egypt:** "Large textiles of one design and manufacture are also known from Egypt "  For this they just say to go to the museum in Cairo.

Due to the heterogeneity of the data and the evidence of strong linear trend the twelve measurements of the age of the Turin Shroud cannot be considered as repeated measurements of a single unknown quantity. The statement of Damon, Donahue, Gore and eighteen others (1989) that ‘The results provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval’ needs to be reconsidered in the light of the evidence produced by our use of robust statistical techniques."

https://www.academia.edu/4294684/Microscopic_and_macroscopic_characteristics_of_the_Shroud_of_Turin_image_superficiality

**Is just a review article and didn't involve any original research!**

**Good source to site for basic facts about shroud**

"The Turin Shroud (TS) is a 4.4 m long and 1.1 m wide linen sheet that appears to have enveloped the corpse of a scourged, thorn-crowned, and crucified man who was stabbed in the side with a lance."

"The luminance levels revealed a three-dimensional (3D) image of a human body when interpreted as mapping cloth to body distance."

"In some areas of the frontal image, such as those of the face and perhaps the hands, the TS body image is **superficial on both sides**."

At the fiber level the image is superficial in the sense that the color alteration of the fiber is restricted to chemical changes in the approximately 200 nm thick external cell layer. At the thread level the coloration is superficial in the sense that the it extends only to depths of 2 or 3 fibers into the thread. At the fabric level these superficial colorations at the thread and fiber levels cumulatively produce the phenomenon called “the image.”

"In agreement with STURP, the yellowish color of the image results from some kind of dehydration and oxidation of the fibers."

"The Shroud threads are composed of linen fibers of 10–20 μm diameter"

"The darker portions of the image are not due to a variation of the degree of the yellowing of the fiber, but rather to the presence of more yellowed fibrils per unit area.. the hue of the discolored fibers is the same in light and dark density areas"

" the coloration does not appear under the crossing threads of the weave or penetrate the cloth"

"In contrast to the blood area, there is no evidence of cementation between fibers or capillary flow of liquids in image fibers"

"The fibers indicate a difference in the degree of oxidation and dehydration between image and nonimage fibers; organic functional groups that are characteristic of dehydratively oxidized, degraded cellulose have been found... under phase contrast microscopy, image fibers show “corroded” surfaces as would be expected for an oxidatively degraded cellulosic material"

"No image is found formed under the blood stains."

"Figure 1. Rather than radiation reflected from the surface of the cloth, the photo depicts the radiation transmitted by the TS through the water stains, scorches, blood, and body image. In the transmission photograph those marks which permeated the TS remain evident, but the body image disappears almost completely demonstrating its extreme superficiality."

**Color follows a fiber:** "The image has a distinct preference for running along the individual fibers making up a yarn, coloring some but not others. Fibers further from a flat surface, tangent to the fabric, are less colored, but from the photographs a color concentration can be detected in correspondence to crevices where two or three yarns cross each other."

**No protein painting medium**:  "Chemical tests showed that there is no protein painting medium or protein-containing coating in image areas."

**Color goes all the way around a fiber:** "If a fiber is colored, it is uniformly colored around its cylindrical surface; relatively long fibers show variation in color from non-image to image area"

"No image is formed under the blood stains."

"The hue of the body image is everywhere nearly the same: the measured16 chromaticity coordinates (CIE x, y ,z) are in the range of 0.480–0.515 for x and 0.410–0.417 for y. The image chiaroscuro is instead a result of different concentrations of yellow to light brown fibers having almost the same color."

**One pixel per 5mm image resolution:** "The dimension of the finest detail observable in the TS body image, is nominally 4.9±0.5 mm, 17 and not comparable with thread or fiber dimensions."

**Image can't be reproduced:**  "Many experiments have been carried out and many hypotheses have been formulated about the body image formation mechanism but none of them have been able to experimentally reproduce and completely explain what can be directly seen looking at the TS."

**Rogers' diffising gas can't create the image:**  "Rogers12 proposed an image formation mechanism involving diffusion, but diffusion seems unable to explain, among other characteristics, the image resolution17 of 4.9±0.5 mm and the uniform coloration of the linen fibers around their circumference with the absence of image in the adjacent fibers."

**Coronal discharge experiments can't create enough energy:**  "Fanti21 proposed an alternate image formation mechanism based on Corona Discharge that may be able to theoretically explain all the characteristics detected on the TS image, but is not able to reproduce all of them in a laboratory because the intensity of the required energy source is too high."

**Image fibers are weaker:** "The mechanical resistance to tensile stress of image fibers is lower than that of nonimage fibers."

Investigating a Dated Piece of the Shroud of Turin, 2010
--------------------------------------------------------

Rachel A Freer-Waters and A J Timothy Jull. Radiocarbon, 2010.
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.692.3190&rep=rep1&type=pdf

The authors argue against the repair hypothesis through microscope images of
part of the cloth cut to use in the 1988 C14 dating.

"Analysis of the weave structure of this particular fragment revealed a
3/1-twill weave."

"The fiber content is linen, a bast fiber from the cultivated plant Linum
usitatissimum (Florian 1990), as shown in Figure 2."

"Cotton fibers were observed on three occasions, with one isolated shown in
Figure 4"

"Under UV fluorescence, the fibers fluoresce uniformly and do not show any
indication of an overall coating."

"Small dark spots were visible in small quantities and do not reflect at all
under UV light, which leads us to believe these are small iron oxide particles"

"Variations are going to be present in any hand-made textile, and small amounts
of foreign materials are to be expected on any textile hundreds of years old."

"**The presence of a few cotton fibers is not unusual. It is possible cotton**
**fibers are present from wrapping the textile in a cotton cloth, a practice that**
**is still used in textile storage**. It is also possible that processing of the
fibers or the loom contained remnants of cotton fibers, which contaminated the
shroud. We can also state that the linen fibers observed in this study have only
low levels of contamination by a few cotton fibers, consistent with the original
observations on the shroud (e.g. Raes 1976) that there are a few cotton fibers
on (or in) the shroud."

"**we find no evidence for any coatings or dyeing of the linen.** Rogers (2005)
suggested that the fibers in his study, which came from the Raes fragments (e.g. Heimberger 2009), were coated with a Madder root dye (e.g. alizarin) and mordant. Linen does not readily accept dye, and any surface “coating” would be loosely adhered. We viewed a textile fragment dyed using traditional methods under UV light, and observed absolutely no similarity in UV fluorescence consistent with such a dye. Rogers (2005) and others assert that the Raes and
the “radiocarbon samples” he studied are dyed, in contrast to the main part of the shroud. As stated by Rogers (2005), “No other part of the shroud shows such a coating.”"

"The sampling of the Shroud of Turin in 1988 is stated by those present (e.g. D
J Donahue, personal communication, 2010) to have been taken “from the main part
of the shroud.” Those removing the samples at the time were aware of repair
material. We conclude from our observations and the history of our sample, that our sample was taken from the main part of the shroud. There is no evidence to the contrary. We find no evidence to support the contention that the 14C samples actually used for measurements are dyed, treated, or otherwise manipulated.  Hence, we find no reason to dispute the original 14C measurements, since our sample is a fragment cut on the arrival of the Arizona 14C sample in Tucson on 24 April 1988 by coauthor Jull, and has been in his custody continuously."

But the authors note in the caption for figure 5:

"High-magnification image of a fiber bundle, showing the presence of a cotton
fiber, unidentified fibers, and debris. This area appears to have been exposed
to more contamination than other samples."  and

"In one case, we were unable to determine whether a cotton fiber was observed
within a bundle of fiber still partially intact from the yarn structure or
whether this is surface contamination, as shown in Figure 5. This image also
shows another possible cotton fiber, some severely damaged unidentifiable
fibers, and general debris, indicating this area was more exposed and more
vulnerable to loose contamination."

### Main points:

-   Three in one weave

-   Linen with iron oxide particles and small amounts of cotton

-   Contrary to Rogers, there were no coatings or dyes.

-   Paper's co-author Jull was among those who took the sample in 1988, and Jull
    has had it since then.

-   Jull and the others were aware of the repaired corner when they took the
    sample in 1988.

### Online comment:

"it’s a bit unbelievable that Jull and Freer-Waters are working on this small
sample since the 2008 (<http://uanews.org/node/22384>) and after two years have
produced a paper so poor: only microscopical analysis at max 320x (Rogers
observations were at max 800x); no chemical analysis (Rogers made many chemical
analysis); fiber unidentified! and they can not tell us if the cotton is on or in
the threads!"

## Life-size Reproduction of the Shroud of Turin and its Image, 2010

L. Garlaschelli.  J. Imaging Sci. Technol.  2010.
https://library.imaging.org/jist/articles/54/4/art00002

### Image Formation:

It was originally painted, but impurities in ochre degraded and chemically etched the cellulose in the linen fibers:  "The most likely explanation, in our opinion, is that the image, as it can be seen today, is a chemical etching of the cellulose of the linen fibers. This degradation can be accounted for by non-neutral impurities contained in the ochre that a medieval artist used to generate the image by a simple rubbing technique. The original pigment came off during the many years of the Shroud’s history, leaving the well-known ghostly weak image. This hypothesis, originally put forward by Nickell, had never been tested experimentally. We have now shown that full-size Shroud-like images can be produced by a rubbing technique on a human body; the face, however, must be obtained from a bas-relief to avoid the inescapable wrap-around distortion. We have also shown that pigments containing traces of acidic compounds can be artificially aged after the rubbing step in such a way that when the pigment is removed, an image is obtained which has most of the characteristics of the Shroud of Turin: it is a pseudonegative; it is fuzzy, with half tones; it resides on the topmost fibers of the cloth; it has some 3D embedded properties; and it does not fluoresce"

### General features of the shroud

He summarizes STURP's conclusions:

"Although some theoretical work has been done to understand just how a sheet might have been laid over the body, the image seems to lack the wraparound lateral distortions that are to be expected from any likely interaction between a human shape and a cloth. The image has been called an “orthogonal projection” of a body onto a surface. This is particularly evident in the Shroud’s facial image"

"The image is not a continuous tone one, but is formed by many tiny discrete discolored spots on the topmost fibers. Changes in the intensity of the image are due to a greater number of these spots per unit surface and not to their deeper color hue. For this reason, the image is often referred to as being a 'half-tone.'"

### Previous work with chemical discoloration:

**Pellicori proposes oils, myrhh or aloes from skin contact:** "Pellicori put forward a theory suggesting that perspiration, oils, myrrh or aloes present on the skin would transfer to the cloth by direct contact; the latent image might develop later by a slow process of locally catalyzed cellulose degradation. He experimentally demonstrated that linen stains, having many of the optical and chemical properties observed for the Shroud image, can be produced by treating a cloth with a thin coating of these substances and then baking in an oven at high temperatures 125–160°C for several hours.  As far as optical reflectance is concerned, it has been stated that Pellicori’s experiments with chemically induced cellulose degradation have so far provided the closest approximation to the observed image characteristics.  Pellicori’s hypothesis involves a contact and a material transfer between the body and the cloth, which would also explain the well-defined traces left by the blood rivulets and by the scourge marks."

"Thus, one major shortcoming of Pellicori’s proposed hypothesis seems to be just how a contact mechanism could have operated to produce the observed peculiar shading and density gradations of the image of the Shroud. We also notice that the image is present at locations where no bodycloth contact is likely, for example, around the hands. Further objections to the hypothesis that the Shroud is not an artifact are of course possible: for example, it is a physical impossibility for blood oozing from the scalp to flow at the outer surface of the hair. Instead, the whole hair mass should be matted and smeared.22 Moreover, long hair should fall down at the sides of the face and could not possibly leave the kind of imprint one can see in the Shroud."

**Naked guy covered in paint:**  "A naked, bearded male volunteer (1.91 m tall and weighing 75 kg), fitted with a long-haired wig, was evenly painted with a red viscous liquid (red ochre suspended in a bath-foam gel) and carefully covered with a flat sheet. The results [Figure 3(a)] show, as expected, that only the more prominent parts of the body would leave an imprint on the cloth. In a second test, the cloth was lightly damp.  Figure 3(b) shows the imprints when more portions of the body came in contact with the cloth. These experiments allow us to notice two main features. First, the larger the body areas that contact the sheet, the more the resulting lateral distortions are evident. Second, the body is far less distorted than the head, as it is relatively flatter. Also, large creases of the fabric cannot be avoided... in this test the viscous color completely soaked the cloth and showed on the opposite side, and the image, being produced by a contact mechanism, had no shading or half-tone quality."

**Arms Relax to the side:**  "We also became aware that the position of the arms and of the hands cannot be held if the muscles are relaxed, as would be the case for a corpse, but requires a conscious effort. For the hands to stay in such a posture as seen on the Shroud, they would have to be tied together, but no sign of tying is apparent."

**Attempts via scorching:**  " The most accomplished attempt at such an approach [via scorching] was that of Vittorio Pesce Delfino,29 who however limited himself to the reproduction of the face of the Shroud. Since a full-3D head would leave a grossly distorted print, he made use of a flat bronze bas-relief which he heated to 220°C and onto which he briefly pressed a linen cloth. This experiment yields an image that shows most of the properties of the Shroud image, since it is a pseudonegative, is shaded, has no pigments in it, is superficial, and does indeed exhibit embedded 3D information.

**No known historical examples of painting negative images:**  "this would imply that the artist painted “in the negative,” something that is not easily achieved and of which there are no historical known examples."

**Image is from dehydrated cellulose:**  "We concede that the image on the Shroud today is formed by dehydrated cellulose of the linen, that is, the alteration of the cellulose was effected by some component, still undetermined, of the pigment or binder. There is no doubt that this dehydration took place since the linen of the Shroud image areas is distinctly yellowed compared to the off-image areas."

### Their image hypothesis

**Wet cloth on bas relief, dried, then powdered, acidic pigment applied with dauber, rubbed or washed off centuries later:**  "Nickell1 described a contact transfer mechanism that might produce the observed contour density effects. His technique involves molding a wetted cloth to conform to the surface contours of a suitable (cold) bas-relief model. The cloth is allowed to dry, and powdered pigment is applied with a cotton or cloth dauber... an artist might have prepared a suitable mixture of pigments, molded a linen sheet over the bas-relief he had constructed, and used a dauber (also termed a tamper) to apply the mixture to the surface of the linen. If he wanted to represent a body print on a cloth, the protruding parts were obviously supposed to leave darker traces, and the receding ones lighter or no traces. The bas-relief rubbing method automatically produces not only an apparent negative image but also an image with crude three-dimensional properties. Unlike a photographic negative, in which light and dark are reversed, a bas-relief rubbing produces a sort of negative in which topographically high areas become dark and low areas become light because the topographically higher areas receive more of the pigment and lower areas receive less. Furthermore, as the pigment is applied, there is a gradation of its density from topographically higher to lower areas, producing the tonal variation that creates a crude three-dimensional quality. This frottage technique is very simple and also would have generated a very visible image for the veneration of worshipers. The current Shroud image is extremely faint and barely discernible. But the original Shroud image was likely darker and clearer to the unaided eye since the Shroud was the subject of paintings in earlier centuries when artists did not have the benefit of filtered, high-contrast images, and high-resolution photography. The rubbing technique also fits well with what D’Arcis wrote in his memorandum about the artist who confessed to having forged the Shroud. The cloth had been “subtili modo depictus” (painted in a cunning way). "

"It is safe to assume, too, that a loosely bound pigment residing on the surface of the weave might have worn off in time. Furthermore, the tiny amount of residual pigment still tenaciously clinging to the cloth would account for the very large number of microscopic particles of iron oxide (ochre) found by McCrone only in the image areas, and by others between the Shroud and its backing cloth."

"The artist could have rubbed over a bas-relief for the face only but over a real body for the figure."

"It has been often pointed out that the head and the body of the Shroud do not have the correct proportions, i.e., the head is a little too small. Also, the average intensity of the face color is ca 10% greater than that of the body.3This would be a likely result if the face image had been put on the cloth at a different time than the body image. Finally, below the face of the Shroud there is a very conspicuous and strange mark, which looks like a neck or a collar... if the bas-relief of a face was used, a sculptor or a wood carver would most likely have manufactured it with a neck."

"It turned out that it is not easy at all to apply the dust pigment evenly on a cloth covering a soft three-dimensional body. Furthermore, there are spots, in particular under the model’s chin, where creases of the cloth cannot be avoided and where application of the pigment is nearly impossible. Finally, the rendering of the arms is not as expected... When rubbing the model’s upper arms, their imprints almost always tend to point outwards, although the model was instructed to keep them in tight contact with his chest, and his elbows were supported by 10-cm-thick small blocks or cushions.."

"in our experiments, we had to rub the pigment only over the more prominent features of the model. The image obtained can then be completed freehand and improved in a few spots by adding some more pigment, after removing the cloth from the volunteer’s body. This procedure also allows one to rub the pigment more evenly and more easily than when the cloth is resting over a 3D human body. In particular, the “covered,” partially visible hand is a difficult feature to reproduce by rubbing, possibly because the stiff fabric cannot adequately conform to the sharp relief of this spot. Therefore, we completed the prints of the fingers by painting them subsequently with ochre and a small brush. If the mediaeval artist, too, had this problem and solved it in our same way, this would finally explain why the fingers look so puzzlingly unnatural and anatomically unconvincing"

"Of course, the results (Figures 6 and 7) do not look like the actual Shroud of Turin: rather, they look the way the Shroud must have looked shortly after it was made. The image is much more visible, the pigment is still there, and there are no water stains and burn marks."

No matter how accurate a replica can be obtained, no accelerated aging technique will ever be completely equivalent to the natural process, which took years or centuries to be accomplished; furthermore, only the main agreed-upon features of the Shroud and not the microscopic ones will probably be imitated. Thus, the real aim of our experiments is to suggest a plausible mechanism for the image formation, rather than achieving a perfect (and impossible) reproduction."

**Visually acceptable:** "At the end of our experiment, a visually acceptable replica of the Shroud of Turin was obtained. When photographed, it showed the expected pseudo-negativity properties (Figs. 8 and 9). The negative image also shows the required shading and half-tone effect. The image was superficial, residing on the front side of the cloth only. No image or part of it could be seen on the backside"

### Anatomical Accuracy is difficult to determine

"The accuracy of the anatomy of the Man of the Shroud has been debated many times. Some
researchers consider it perfect and flawless,35 others think it looks unnatural. According to Frederick Zugibe,36 it may even show evidence that Jesus suffered from Marfan’s Syndrome, a rare hereditary disease having among its symptoms elongated limbs, long spidery fingers, and a long thin face. Since the image is fuzzy and ruined by burns, it is very doubtful whether accurate anthropometric measurements are possible (for example, in the front image the feet do no even show); thus, the question remains unclear."

## Letter to the Editor Comments on “Life-Size Reproduction of the Shroud of Turin and Its Image” by L. Garlaschelli, 2011

Giulio Fanti and Thibault Heimburger.  2011.
https://library.imaging.org/jist/articles/55/2/art00002

"Garlaschelli considered only some aspects of the TS image but not all. Particularly, Garlaschelli does not consider the important facts detected through the microscope on the TS as described in Ref. 1. For these reasons the present authors do not agree with Garlaschelli’s conclusions which state, “The most likely explanation, in our opinion, is that the image, as it can be seen today, is a chemical etching of the cellulose of the linen fibers.”"

"First of all, according to Fanti et al.1 the cellulose of the TS fibers is not colored; the color does not penetrate into the fiber but it is found only as a 0.2 m thick thin layer at the surface of the fiber. Second etching colors the whole cellulose of a linen fiber, and it is for this reason that, in agreement with Ref. 6, etching seems not to be a reliable hypothesis for the explanation of the body image formation on the TS."

"The image [from Garlaschelli] is not continuous and has no fuzzy contour. There is no color at all in noncontact areas. The image/nonimage spatial variation (image resolution) in Garlaschelli’s experiment is less than 1 mm while it is 4.9 mm for the TS.2"

"Finally, the proven fact that there is no image color under the blood stains on the TS, which demonstrated that the blood was first on the linen and prevented the formation of the image in those areas, remains very difficult to understand in any hypothesis involving a forger (including Garlaschelli’s hypothesis)."

"Incidentally, from Garlaschelli himself (personal email to the second author), there is, as expected, no fluorescent halo around his “blood stains” made of pigments, contrary to the serum haloes present on the TS."

Autogol a Tucson / Own Goal in Tucson, di Gian Marco Rinaldi, 2010.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

google translated here: https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/10/quote-of-the-day-3/

Autogol happens when a player scores a point against his own team, e.g., during
a soccer game.

 

"Freer and Jull damage to the fabric thickness value of 250 microns. Vercelli made 10 measurements the reserve sample to obtain an average of 390 microns with a minimum of 340 and a maximum of 430. John Jackson measured in different areas of the cloth found values between 318 and 391 microns."

Jull's piece came from the larger piece given to Arizona:

"In fact it was known that in 1988 the Arizona lab received the sample into two parts, a high of 39.5 mg   and a small 14.2-mg. The workshop gave four subsamples, but so far no one knew how it was subdivision was made, that no one knew if it was used only the larger piece, or even the  smaller piece. But now, seeing the photograph of the preserved fragment, we can exclude that this is the small piece or part, because the form does not match. So the current fragment was cut from the large piece of 39.5 mg, leaving a piece of 27.1 mg."

Radiocarbon date increases with each C14 dated sample.  If Arizona used the small strip and large strip, that would put their date consistent with the other labs, but explain why Jull's was the least contaminated:

"[Giulio] Fanti claims to have shown that the radiocarbon age of the tissue varies with position within the few inches of the strip was taken. In this strip, starting from the edge of the sheet, the order was as follows: reserve sample, small piece of Arizona, Oxford, Zurich;    large piece of Arizona.  Since Oxford has found an average of dates older than the dates and Arizona  Young, Fanti and colleagues hope to demonstrate that there is a change of date in a linear. But Arizona had assumed that he had dated only large piece, beyond the edge of Zurich.  If, as now relies, at least one third of the material dated from Arizona came from the small piece, who was at the other end of the strip and on the other side of Oxford, then the presumed linearity is no more."

Evidence is not proof: A response to Prof Timothy Jull, 2011
------------------------------------------------------------

Mark Oxley.  https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf

### Main Points

1.  Nobody has refuted the first century evidence of the Shroud, or explained
    how the Shroud could be produced in the middle ages.

2.  Photo evidence supports Marino & Benford's patch hypothesis, contra
    Flury-Lemberg.

3.  The radiocarbon labs kept sloppy records and not all remaining pieces of the
    cloth are accounted for.

4.  The carbon labs tested pieces significantly smaller than the minimum size
    needed (5mg) for an accurate result. (But this doesn't make sense. AMS can
    date samples as small as 0.5mg, and if it's erroneous why did the three labs
    get similar numbers.)

5.  A 1997 paper, "The Holy Shroud of Turin, Silent Witness in Preparation for a
    Centenary," accuses Dr. Tite of orchestrating a substitution of the samples.

6.  Jull and his co-author have warp and weft thread counts swapped.

7.  Jull measured their piece to be 250 microns thick, while everyone else says
    the thickness is between 340 and 430 microns.

### Quotes

"To definitely prove that the Shroud is of mediaeval origin would require the
following: 1) Undisputed rebuttal of all the evidence showing it to be older
than mediaeval. 2) A scientifically valid and rigorously tested explanation of
how the Shroud was produced in the middle ages. 3) Replication of the Shroud,
using materials available in the middle ages, to a standard where the replicated
image exactly matches the image on the Shroud in every physical and chemical
detail. None of this has been done."

"The Patch Hypothesis of Marino and Benford has been criticized by other
researchers, notably the textile expert Mme Mechthild Flury-Lemburg, who
maintains that the weaving technique described by Marino and Benford did not
exist in Europe in the mid-sixteenth century and that there is no reweave in the
Shroud. However, the 4 examinations carried out by Rogers and Brown, as well
as the photographic studies cited, provide strong evidence (but not proof!) in
support of the hypothesis."

"When Jull published his paper and announced that he had examined a portion of
the radiocarbon sample retained by the University of Arizona, some eyebrows were
raised among Shroud researchers, as it was not known that a portion of the
sample had been kept. Indeed, the paper by Damon et al published in Nature in
February 1989, “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin”, gives the firm
impression that the entire sample received by Arizona was used for dating
purposes."

"The conversion factor between the weight of the Turin Shroud cloth and its
carbon weight is 24%. The weight of cloth to be tested must therefore be a
minimum of 20,83 mg. However the Arizona laboratory only used two samples for
testing, weighing 14,72 mg and 11,83 mg respectively, and these were themselves
divided into two. The carbon weights of the tested samples would therefore have
been approximately 1,77 mg in the case of the larger piece and 1,42 mg in the
case of the smaller piece, well below the agreed threshold for an acceptable
result. The same applies to the other testing laboratories in Zurich and Oxford.
None of the samples tested would have met the 5 mg threshold."

"They also describe the thickness of the textile as being approx. 250 microns.
In a paper commenting on Jull’s textile measurements, appositely titled “Own
Goal in Tucson”, the Italian writer Gian Marco Rinaldi also states that the
researcher Vercelli had made 10 measurements of the thickness of the Shroud and
had found an average of 390 microns, with a minimum of 340 microns and a maximum
of 430 microns. Dr John Jackson had reported values between 318 microns and 391
microns. Either Jull and Freer-Waters made an error in their measurement or
their sample has different physical characteristics in terms of thickness to
other parts of the Shroud."

 

Some details about the STURP Quad Mosaic images, 2011

Barry Schwortz, 2011, http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf

"These color images should be interpreted as chemical composition maps. We don't
know from the images what these chemicals are, only that they are not the same
everywhere."

"The fact that the white light photographs show a different coloration in this
area, along with the UV fluorescence photography images which clearly show
different fluorescence properties in exactly the same areas, coupled with Ray
Rogers' detailed chemical and microscopic analyses and the Marino/Benford textile
evidence that has been presented over the last few years, all make me believe
that the 1988 c14 samples of the Shroud were taken from an anomalous portion of
the cloth."

## Jewish Shrouds and Funerary Customs: a Comparison with the Shroud of Turin.  2012.

Grossi, Ada.  "[Jewish Shrouds and Funerary Customs: a Comparison with the Shroud of Turin](https://www.academia.edu/2427474/Jewish_Shrouds_and_Funerary_Customs_a_Comparison_with_the_Shroud_of_Turin_in_1st_International_Congress_on_the_Holy_Shroud_in_Spain_Valencia_April_28_30_2012_ed_Centro_Espa%C3%B1ol_de_Sindonologia_CES_)"   1st International Congress on the Holy Shroud in Spain – Valencia.  2012.

**Cubit sizes can vary**  "A most disputed point is that of the possible relations between the Shroud's dimensions and some units of measurements known and used in ancient times. This is a very delicate matter, that ought to be approached with due caution: first of all because Hebrew measurements have always been object of halachic debates among Rabbis; second, because the dimensions of the Shroud, made of linen fabric which underwent multiple stresses during many centuries, are to be considered as average measurements, not exact per se. This problem, brought to light by Rebecca Jackson25 and others, got a wide echo and is still a matter of heated controversy26 . According to Jackson, the Shroud of Turin's dimension are multiples of an alleged «Syrian cubit» (21.7'', i.e. 55.1 cm)27: 8 cubits of width and 2 of length, that is 4.408 by 110.2 m, which are in fact pretty close to the Shroud's dimensions. This alleged Syrian cubit is sometimes quoted as Philetarian cubit, adopted by Philetaerus king of Pergamon (4th-3rd cent. B.C.): by the way, it actually corresponds to a different measure28 . The debate about ancient cubits is no easy matter: the length of common cubits varies between 44.5 and 45.7 cm and that of royal cubits between 50.3 and 52.4 cm29; as for the «Syrian cubit», more correctly called Assyrian cubit, its measure is uncertain just as much, and it seems therefore unwise to identify it at all costs with a submultiple of the Shroud's dimensions30 . As far as the Hebrew cubit is concerned, it measures about 45.7 cm31 and corresponds to the ammah32, the Biblical cubit; in addition, Jewish sources often mention the biblical and talmudic gomed33, which, according to some, is actually shorter than the ammah; furthermore, in the Mishnah we can find two other cubits (M Kelim 17:9). Thus, we can say that Rabbinical knowledge basically deals with two cubits, the Mosaic cubit, 45.7 cm long, and a longer one, which varies between 56.018658 and 58.352 cm34 . In the Jewish tradition, cubit is indeed used for textiles, but it's definitely more often used in architecture or to evaluate distances in general: fabrics, as in other cultural environments, are typically measured in units referring to the human body (fingers, hands and arms: fingerbreadth, handbreadth and ell). Now, if one wishes to go further and find questionable correspondences between the Shroud's dimensions and Hebrew units of measurements, it could even be noted that the side strip's width, about 8 cm, is actually very close to 7.8 cm, which is the tefach otzev, i.e. the Hebrew handbreadth (considering the width of the palm, measured along the 4 knuckles)35 . Thus, the Shroud's length would be 56 tefachim (436.8 cm) and its width 14 tefachim (13+1, that is 109.2 cm = 101.4 + 7.8 cm); on the other hand, always keeping in mind that these measurements are approximate, we could also evaluate the Shroud's dimensions by the tefach sochek (9.33 cm), and we would obtain even more interesting numbers: 47 tefachim (438,52 cm) by 12 tefachim (11+1, i.e. 111.96 cm = 102.63 + 9.33 cm). This line of reasoning certainly suggests great caution: playing with numbers, any result can be achieved36 ."

**Summary of Jewish burial customs:** "In a nutshell, the ritual operations to perform on a corpse to honour the dead (Kevod HaMet) can be thus summarized: the family of the dead had to take care of funeral and burial within the day when the death occurred, before sunset, because it's not allowed leaving a body unburied overnight41; the body has to be constantly watched and those who keep vigil are free from precepts and prayers42; the first thing to do is to close the eyes of the dead43 (possibly by the firstborn, remembering Gn 46:4)44, then the jaw and every orifice45; the preparation of the body is generally a women's duty and consists of cleansing and anointing the corpse with oils and perfumes, washing it with water46, trimming the hair, and wrapping it in a burial shroud meant to «keep» the body47; candles are sometimes lit at the head or feet of the body and spices are often placed upon the shroud, to be burnt during the funeral procession leading to the burial place or to be spread on the bier48 (as for Jesus' times, see the σοροῦ upon which the son of Nain widow was laid in Lc 7:14) 49; in some cases the body, wrapped in a shroud, could also be finally laid in a wooden coffin upon arrival to the burial site50; on the third day (at any rate within three days), the relatives have to visit the tomb51 to verify if the dead is actually such, to avoid the risk of apparent death52, and, if necessary, to complete the burial procedures; if the relatives of the deceased couldn't afford a rock-hewn tomb with chambers, they could bury the body underground: rich people's bones were usually transferred to ossuaries after one year."

**Above, she explains that it was common for people returned to the tomb after (or within) 3 days to complete the burial.**

**List of Talmudic references to burial shrouds:**  Mishnah Kilayim 9:4; Mishnah Ma'aser Sheni 5:12; Babylonian Talmud Shabbath 114a; Babylonian Talmud Shabbath 150b; Babylonian Talmud Shabbath 151b; Babylonian Talmud 'Erubin 41b; Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 40b; Babylonian Talmud Beitzah 6a; Babylonian Talmud Megilah 26b; Babylonian Talmud Mo'ed Katan 27b; Babylonian Talmud Yebamoth 74a; Babylonian Talmud Ketuboth 111b; TB Nazir 51a; Babylonian Talmud Baba Bathra 137a; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 46a; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 47a; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 47b; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 48a; Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 48b; Babylonian Talmud Avodah Zarah 17a; TB Avodah Zarah 65b; Babylonian Talmud Menachoth 41a;Babylonian Talmud Nidah 20a; Babylonian Talmud Nidah 27b; Babylonian Talmud Nidah 37a; Babylonian Talmud Nidah 61b; Babylonian Talmud Kelim 27b (Mishnah Kelim 24:14).

## A New Look at the Validity of the Carbon-14 Dating of the Shroud.  2014.

Villarreal, Roberto, and Roberta Villarreal.  "[A New Look at the Validity of the Carbon-14 Dating of the Shroud](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf)."  2014.

This is similar to Villarreal's 2008 paper?

They had a thread that Ray Rogers gave them just before he died.  They applied these tests to the thread:

1. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy 
2. Tube Excited and Radioactive Source Micro-spot Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (MXRF) Spectrometry 
3. High and Low Powered Magnification with a High Resolution Photo-Microscope 
4. Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) with Reflectance Mode Capability 
5. Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (TOF-SIMS)

**Thread broke into three pieces during one of the tests:** "The TOF-SIMS analyses system brought the analytical measurements to a halt when the “spliced thread” separated into 3 pieces after the high vacuum it was under was neutralized. The three distinct pieces were 1) a fuzzy end that was white (Region 1), 2) a tight woven end that was yellow (Region 2) and 3) a micron-sized circular cocoon-shaped brown crust that seemed to be connecting the two ends. This appears to be the same as the brown encrustations on the Raes and radiocarbon threads. "

**Iron from retting helps date the cloth:** "The finding of pure iron in the cloth also helps date the making of the cloth. Iron, calcium and strontium are distributed throughout the cloth of the shroud. Before it was used as a burial cloth, it traditionally would have been treated by a wet retting process, to make the cloth white and supple. This unintentionally resulted in an ion-exchange process that gave at least 90% of the iron in a chemically pure form (>99%) without contamination from natural manganese, nickel, or cobalt. Iron in nature always has these impurities."

**Dirt on heel and knee:** "One of the first tests performed directly on the Shroud by the STURP team during the 1978 study of the Shroud was Reflective Spectroscopy conducted by Roger and Marty Gilbert. They seemed to be having analytical difficulties when the spectra they were obtaining changed when they reached the area of the heel. The problem seemed to resolve itself only to reappear when they reached the knee area where they obtained spectra different from the rest of the cloth except for the problem area of the heel. Again the problem resolved itself only to reappear eventually at the nose. They called on the Sam Pellicori, an Optical Spectroscopist, who via a vertical mounted sliding macroscope looked at the heel area and declared the reason for the “abnormal” readings was “dirt.” In retrospect, Eric Jumper who was the lead person for that experiment concluded that it was appropriate that the man on the Shroud would have dirt on selected parts of his body, especially the heel, and particularly if he had fallen."

**Limestone Aragonite found on the foot:** "In 1982, Ray Rogers sent a sticky tape microscope slide with a speck of an undetermined composition from the heel area to Dr. Joseph Kohlbeck, an Optical Crystallographer at the Hercules Aerospace Center in Utah for analysis to determine if there was anything interesting in the slide. Dr. Kolbeck identified the dark speck as Travertine Aragonite, a rare form of calcite. Dr. Kohlbeck completed his analysis and his results were received with great interest. He eventually passed the slide with the speck to Dr. Ricardo Levi-Setti, Scientist at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago. His analysis also showed that the speck was Aragonite. I called both scientists on March 11, 2012 to verify the results. Cesar Barta of Spain now has the speck.

As a follow-up to this, limestone samples were taken from at least 9 tombs throughout the Jerusalem area but only a separate sample taken from near the Damascus Gate near Golgotha contained Aragonite. 

The fact that Aragonite, a rare form of calcite, was the identified species of limestone on the foot of the man on the Shroud and was also found at on the ground at Golgotha near the Damascus Gate points to a connection between the man of the Shroud and the Biblical Jesus."

**Bleach on cloth may explain why blood is so red:** "Saponaria solutions are hemolytic; that is they release red hemoglobin from blood cells with which they come into contact. If the Shroud cloth had been bleached and washed with Saponaria that would provide a possible reason the blood on the cloth is still red.

Rogers initiated tests with Diane Soran in which they obtained some soapwort plants and made a solution of Saponaria. They then added blood to Saponaria-washed and non-Saponaria washed home-made linen. After 25 years, the blood on the Saponaria washed cloth was still red while the blood on the non-Saponaria-washed cloth became black. The black color began to set in after a few days. The linen cloth of the Shroud retains the blood in a red color that is so fresh looking that the 1978 STURP team was quite surprised at the intensity of the color. This seemed to indicate that the Shroud cloth had been washed with a mild ancient washing and bleaching technique that preserved the red blood color."



## Superficial and Shroud-like coloration of linen by short laser pulses in the vacuum ultraviolet.  2012

**Abstract:**  "We present a survey on five years of experiments of excimer laser irradiation of linen fabrics, seeking a coloration mechanism able to reproduce the microscopic complexity of the body image embedded onto the Shroud of Turin. We achieved a superficial, Shroud-like coloration in a narrow range of irradiation parameters. We also obtained latent coloration that appears after artificial or natural aging of linen following laser irradiations that, at first, did not generate any visible effect. Most importantly, we have recognized photochemical processes that account for both coloration and latent coloration"

**Shroud is inaccessible:**  "scientists complain the Shroud has been seldom accessible. Indeed, the most recent indepth experimental analysis of the images on the Shroud was carried out in 1978 by the multidisciplinary team of the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP). 

**STRUP used best tech:**  "They used the most advanced instruments available at that time, which were supplied by various manufacturers, having a commercial value of over two million dollars. The Shroud was examined by ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared spectrometry, x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, microscopy, thermography, pyrolysis mass spectrometry, lasermicroprobe Raman analyses, microchemical testing, and fiber sampling [3–13]. 

**Not painted or dyed:**  "These analyses did not find pigments or artist’s media on the Shroud, except for some iron oxide particles, micrometer-size cinnabar, and small traces of vermilion (HgS) [13]. However, there is a large body of scientific evidence [8,11,12,16] that the microscopic observations reported in [13] cannot support the Shroud image is a painting. It is likely the microscopic debris particles have been transferred by contact of pigments from artist’s copies of the Shroud that have been “sanctified” by pressing the two images together [17]."

**Shroud coloration depth is 200nm:**  "The Shroud’s image is superficial as the color resides on the outer surface of the fibers that make up the threads of the cloth [8,11].  Recent measurements on image fibers of the Shroud [19 - Fanti 2010] confirmed that the coloration depth is approximately 200 nm, which corresponds to the thickness of the primary cell wall of the linen fiber [22]. In a single linen thread, there are some 200 fibers."

The colored (image) fibers are brittle, show “corroded” surfaces, and are more fragile than uncolored fibers [8,11]. When illuminated by UV light of a lamp, image fibers emit a reduced fluorescent light compared with fibers out of the image [3].

**Oxidation and dehydration, like advanced aging:**  The coloration of the Shroud image was formed by an unknown process that caused oxidation, dehydration, and conjugation of polysaccharide structure of fibers to produce a conjugated carbonyl group as the chromophore [8,11,12]. To some extent, the color is a result of an accelerated aging process of the flax.

**Halftone image, not greater intensity in some places:**  "The image seen at the macroscopic level is an areal density image. This means shading is not accomplished by varying the color but by varying the number of colored fibers per unit area at the microscopic level [5,9,11,12]."

**Human Blood, no image beneath blood:**  "The blood tests positive for human blood, and there is no image on the Shroud beneath bloodstains [12,23]. UV illumination allows observation of typical fluorescence of bilirubin around the main bloodstains [10], which would be consistent with a hemolytic process caused by torture.

**Can't be reproduced:**  "All attempts to create a Shroud-like image have failed to reproduce adequately the above characteristics.  Some researchers have obtained coloration/images that look similar [5,18,20,21], but no one has created images that match all microscopic and macroscopic characteristics of the Shroud image."

**Image not from body contact, cloth loosely draped.  Microscopic complexity of the image.  Billirubin:**  "The front and back images do not show the typical deformations of a 3-D body put in contact with a two-dimensional cloth. As a consequence, we deduce that the image was not formed by contact with the body. This observation suggests the Shroud was loosely draping the body, that is, it was not wrapped around and in full contact with the whole body. This mode is also supported by the gradations of image brightness that correlate with expected cloth–body distances: in fact, there is a geometrical relationship that corresponds to a body shape and a cloth draping naturally over that shape [14].  Moreover, this “draping mode” is consistent with the lack of image of the body’s sides. These considerations, combined with the extreme shallowness of the image color, the absence of pigments, and the subliminal, microscopic complexity of image at the fiber level, make unlikely obtaining a Shroud-like image by contact methods (i.e., by chemicals), either in a modern laboratory [20], or a fortiori by a medieval forger. The hypothesis of the medieval forger is also ruled out by the anatomical consistency of blood and serum versus wounds, including the presence of bilirubin, which is invisible to the naked eye. This subliminal feature is only visible by UV fluorescence photography [10] and requires knowledge of anatomy and of forensic medicine [30] not available in the Middle Ages."

**No image under the blood:**  "Under the blood there is no image. This means that the blood stains occurred physically on the Shroud before the body image [8,12].  As a consequence, the image was formed after the deposition of the corpse. Moreover, we observe that all the blood stains have sharp outlines and are flawless, and this poses a question if the corpse was removed from the cloth."

**No body decay:**  "On the Shroud there are no signs of putrefactions, which occur at the orifices about 40 h after death. This means that the image does not depend on putrefaction gases and the corpse was wrapped in the Shroud not longer than two days."

**Infrared laser just burns the cloth:**  "The first attempt to reproduce a Shroud-like coloration by electromagnetic energy used a CO2 laser emitting infrared radiation (wavelength λ  10.6 μm). These experiments produced an image on a linen fabric similar to the Shroud at macroscopic level [21]. However, microscopic analyses showed a bulky coloration and many fibers carbonized, which are not compatible with the Shroud image [1,12]. In fact, the CO2 infrared radiation excites the vibrational energy levels of the irradiated material, with consequent release of thermal energy, which heats the linen threads in the bulk of the fabric. On the contrary, it is well known that the energy carried by short-wavelength radiation breaks the chemical bonds of the irradiated material without inducing a significant heating (photochemical reaction)."

**UV wavelength needed:**  "the smaller thewavelength, the thinner the material necessary to absorb all the radiation. Therefore, we have chosen the UV radiation to obtain at least two of the main characteristics of the Shroud image: a thin coloration depth and a low-temperature image formation."

**Energy pulse at 0.308 μm, 1.67J for 30ns came close, but not as good as VUV laser:**  "we irradiated the linen with the radiation emitted by another XeCl laser that emits pulses 4 times shorter and an energy per pulse 12 times smaller than the Hercules laser ((λ  0.308 μm, single pulse energy 5 J, time duration of each pulse 120 ns)...  We achieved a permanent coloration of the linen in a narrow range of pulse duration, intensity, number of laser pulses, and time interval between successive pulses... the combination of laser parameters necessary to color the linen (the time width of the laser pulses, the intensity/fluence, the number of pulses, the repetition rate) is very narrow. In fact, to obtain the coloring of the flax, UV pulses must be shorter than 50 ns, and small changes of any laser parameter may lead to lack of linen coloration.  However, the hue of the color (brown to dark yellow, depending on the intensity and number of laser shots; see Fig. 3) was darker than the yellowish image of the Shroud. The linen coloration was superficial, but the depth of color was still larger than that of the Shroud image."

**With VUV Laser:**  "In particular, the yellow color in Fig. 4 is obtained when F<sub>T</sub> ≈ 25–27J/cm^2^. When F<sub>T</sub> > 51 J/cm^2^, linen is ablated, and when F<sub>T</sub> > 66 J/cm^2^, linen is vaporized and holed."  

At (λ  0.193 μm, 12 ns, 1 Hz) 

"The ArF laser (λ = 0.193 μm, 0.08 J/pulse, 12 ns, 1 Hz) emits radiation in the VUV spectral region with smaller energy and shorter pulse duration than XeCl lasers."

"As the threads of our linen fabric have an average diameter of 300 μm, we deduce that the light at λ = 0.193 μm penetrates 2% to 9% of the diameter of the linen yarn, depending on the specific conditions of irradiation."

See Fig 6a for an image of only the topmost layer being colored.

**If a weaker pulse is used, image appears only after heating/aging:**  "We cut half of the laser spot on linen irradiated with FT  16 J=cm2, i.e., below the threshold for coloration; see Table 1. As a consequence, the irradiated linen did not appear colored. We then heated one of the two parts by an iron at a temperature of 190  10° C for 10 s, and a coloration appeared immediately after heating. Figure 8 shows that the heating process, which simulates aging, colors only the surface irradiated below threshold and does not color the nonirradiated area... we deduce that the range for obtaining a latent coloration is FT ≈
13–20J=cm2."

"Using the short-pulse XeCl laser, we have obtained a latent coloration similar to that of Fig. 8, which appeared after a natural aging of more than one year, maintaining the linen at room temperature in a dark environment [32]."

"there is the scientific interest of UV and VUV light that breaks chemical bonds in a way to favor the oxidation and dehydrating effect of heat (aging), finally resulting in linen coloration."

**Similar to aging:**  "We can therefore infer that short and high-intensity UV pulses change the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and low-intensity radiation (radon, natural radioactivity, secondary particles from cosmic rays) accumulated in a long-term period do."

"The color of the Shroud image is a result of an accelerated aging process of the linen, similar to the yellowing of ancient papers [40]."

**Image created photochemically and not by heating:**  "During laser irradiations, the room temperature was between 20°C and 21°C, and the linen region irradiated by the UV XeCl laser was heated up to 33°C, while the linen irradiated by the VUV ArF laser was heated up to 25°C. It is known that thermal effects can color the linen only when the linen temperature approaches 200°C [11], and we can conclude that excimer laser coloration is a photochemical process that does not involve significant thermal effects."

**A better laser would be required to reproduce the shroud's halftone effect:**  "However, we did not fully achieved a “half-tone effect” comparable with that observed on the Shroud [5,12]. In principle, it would be possible to replicate exactly this characteristic by laser pulses having a spatial intensity distribution “sawtoothlike” with variable period. This distribution can be achieved by state-of-the-art diffractive optics that arbitrarily modulate the spatial distribution of laser beams [43]."

**They generated many but not all the shroud image characteristics:**  "We then summarized the experiments done at the ENEA Research Center of Frascati, which have demonstrated the ability of VUV light pulses lasting few nanoseconds to generate a Shroud-like coloration on linen that matches many (although not all) characteristics of the Shroud image." 

 "Absolute reflectance measurements show that, when irradiated in the UV and VUV, our linen behaves like the linen of the Shroud"

"In summary, our results demonstrate that a short and intense burst of directional VUV radiation can color a linen cloth so as to reproduce many of the peculiar characteristics of the image on the Shroud of Turin, including the hue of color, the shallow penetration depth of the color, and the inhibition of fluorescence."

**Ray Rogers though VUV couldn't create shroud image, but was wrong:**  "Rogers’ opinion was based on the failure of experiments made at Los Alamos using excimer lasers, but our results demonstrate that their failure was due to parameters (e.g., laser pulse width) outside the narrow range of values able to generate the permanent linen coloration."

**Can only be reproduced with VUV < 50ns:**  "We obtained a linen coloration only in a narrow range of laser parameters. In particular, the temporal duration of the single laser pulse must be shorter than 50 ns [31,32]. While a short laser pulse width is necessary for obtaining a coloration, the VUV laser spectrum allows a coloration limited to the outer surface of the threads."

**Blood would block UV and VUV:**  "Both UV and VUV radiations coloring linen are compatible with the absence of image under the bloodstains on the Shroud because in this spectral region light is absorbed by very thin layers of blood hemoglobin."

**UV can make blood stains more red:**  "the UV light may be responsible for another special feature of the Shroud: the red color of blood stains after so much time since their deposition."

**Dr. Lazzaro summarizes [in an interview](http://www.sci-news.com/physics/scientists-suggest-turin-shroud-authentic.html):**  “For sure, none of the hundreds attempts to obtain a shroud-like image by using chemical contact techniques – i.e. adding chemical substances like colors, powders, etc. – has achieved good results. Usually, the chemical approach gives similar macroscopic results, but it fails when analyzing the coloration with a microscope. At the microscopic level, the contact chemical approach does not give Shroud-like results. On the contrary, attempts using various radiations (vacuum ultraviolet photons, electrons from a corona discharge) give a coloration that looks shroud-like even at the microscopic level."

The setting for the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud, 2012
----------------------------------------------------------

Emanuela Marinelli, https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf

This is a **review paper** citing hundreds of other papers and summarizing their
conclusions in 1-2 sentences. Very useful.

"Archaeologist William Meacham, of the University of Hong Kong, reminding the
use of dating different samples of a site, proposed to take samples from various
parts of the cloth, but Flury-Lemberg objected strongly, thinking that the
borders could not be more contaminated than the rest of the fabric.  STURP
suggested to take samples at least in three different areas of the sheet"

"The trimming was necessary “for the pollution of the cloth itself with threads
of a different nature which even in small amounts could have lead to variations
in dating, being a later addition”"

[Luigi] Gonella explains: “It was blackmail. They put us up against the wall just with a
blackmail. Either we accepted the test of 14C on the terms imposed by the
laboratories, or it would break out a campaign of accusations saying the Church
fears the truth and is an enemy of Science”

"In Zurich it was noted “an odd assortment of debris, from fungi to bits of
nylon”. In Tucson a thread of red silk and blue fibers were found on the sample"

"for the thickness of the fabric [in Jull's sample] it is supplied a value lower
than that of the Shroud."

"IMHO, the reweave hypothesis makes sense only if it was done BEFORE the 1532 fire. Otherwise I can see no reason to make a perfect “invisible reweave” in the C14 corner since many highly visible patches were sewn in 1534."

"I have some evidence that his [Rogers's] radiocarbon samples came truly from the CENTER of the radiocarbon sample. I am just waiting for an important testimony."

A [1993 version](https://www.shroud.com/adler1.htm) of this paper appears on shroud.com, but the version in Alan D. Adler's 2014 book, "The Orphaned Manuscript" contains more text and cites sources as late as 1994.

"Some image studies would suggest some type of radiational or energy transfer type mechanism.  However, the nature of this process at this point in time remains a mystery."

Barry went in 2012 to photo Jull's large sample but not his small one:

"To date, I have received no answer from Dr. Jull to the several e-mails I sent
him to follow up on photographing the remaining sample. I am still prepared to
photograph it should it be made available. According to the experts I spoke
with, most labs would never destroy or use all of an existing sample but would
typically keep some small pieces in reserve."

Even though Joe Marino notes that "Dr. Jull, head at Arizona, is pretty good about responding to emails."
https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/30/special-request-from-hugh-farey/

 

"Even Dr. Jull admitted to me that the 1988 tests were rather poorly performed.
Arguing over the sample site, leaving the room for 30 minutes and returning with
sealed, stainless steel (opaque) containers rather than glass, failure to
perform chemical analyses on the samples (required by their own protocol) or
release the raw data or explain mathematical inconsistencies in the process,
etc., etc., have led to many conspiracy theories. I still personally prefer to
look for a credible, scientific answer (like the reweave theory) than to resort
to conspiracies. In the end however, you reap what you sow."

Comments by Barrie Schwortz, 2014 on searching for cotton fibers
----------------------------------------------------------------

https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/

Hugh said: “Rogers had no opportunity to examine the shroud for interwoven cotton, only stray fibres on sticky tape slides.” That is incorrect. Not only did Rogers examine the actual Shroud in close detail, so did Jackson and Jumper and Pellicori and Devan and many others. I have posted a pdf with some photos I made during the 1978 exam that shows this clearly. The last photo is Rudy Dichtl purchasing the infamous “white cotton gloves” that left modern cotton on the surface of the Shroud. Here’s the link: <http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/sturpmicroscopy.pdf> I hope this is helpful.

"She did not look carefully at the C14 corner because she was not there in 1988.  And her paper is full of mistakes re Rogers’ findings. She obviously did not understand anything about Rogers’ claims. She did not look (to my knowledge) at the threads of the border of the C14 sampling area in 2002 with a microscope. She did not took any piece of threads and she did look at them through a microscope."

"'But why would they have mixed cotton and linen in the reweave?'  
Probably because cotton is much more able to retain the dye found by Rogers than
linen."

"The anomalous C14 corner is made of many “modern” (16 th century ?) blended
cotton/linen THREADS mixed with few ancient linen threads (from the Shroud main
part).  
In the “modern” blended threads both linen and cotton fibers are “modern”.  
We know that because of the lignin/vanillin Wiesner tests."

"Adler performed the same tests on samples from various locations on the Shroud.
No lignin/vanillin in Adler’s tests." (TODO: Find Adler's paper)

## 2014 St. Luis - Robert Villareal

Presentation at the 2014 shroud conference in St. Luis.  Villareal is presenting a paper on the FTIR analysis done by Jon Schoonover, Ph.D.  Hugh Farey said this video said the spectroscopic analysis on the spliced thread was inconclusive as to whether it was cotton or linen.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MXdxTVC7O0&list=UUSv7BD9sKjIcA24ct1Hz_Aw

3:00 I said that's not cotton that linen.  "We analyzed every thread that was sent to us."

8:40 "You can see that each one of these samples that we analyze had a different spectra depending on the age.  And the spectra is typical of those obtained at the clean end of the sample.  Because some of these samples of thread we received, strangely enough, we got different analysis, different functional groups, from one end of the thread to the other end of the thread.  And this was very confusing to us.  But it was a lesson that when we look at samples, the age of the samples, the history of the samples, where the samples came from had to be taken into consideration."  

**Crust:** 10:29, "This is one of the first shroud samples that we thought was a shroud sample but it was just a piece of thread and and we found that that piece of thread had a crust and the crust was had very different spectra than the main thread sample and we say now what what are we what do we make of this crust it is got olefins and and many other what seemed to be like impurities but it was very different from what we expected."

**Doubt about spectrographic results:** 12:25, "It's a mystery as to how we can get any anything to agree with these samples if we don't know all those items and all those parameters and and so this is a for modern samples there are special features and that differentiate what the spectra is going to look like and and it can be highly variable and so knowing that when we got these samples we would analyze them and we had every modern instrument that the world knows and and would get different results from different instruments and it's a very difficult thing and I just wanted to point that out that in doing analysis is not so straightforward."

13:50 "I know Ray Rogers maintained a chain of custody in everything that he did.  And I would go over to his house and he would take out of his little book and look at it and um and he said this sample came from Georgia this sample came from wherever. but he had a chain of custody in everything that he did.  Everything.

14:56,  "[Ray Rogers] stated that because he had always told me I will never say that there was divinity involved in this analysis or we cannot hope to understand the shroud by looking at the divinity of things those things that are divine we've got to use actual techniques that are done and that are that don't have divine or divine portions in them or ideas about them and he was very as straight about that and so consequently there came a time and he was getting pretty feeble and he invited me over to the house and he said you know I looked at this sample and it looked even when I was in Turin and now analyzing this it became obvious that there was some something came and struck this atom or molecule or area and it weakened it and and that's what yielded the the damage to the shroud threads that gave it a color and he said something there is something that did that and I don't know what it is and then he went on to another area."



## Shroud-like coloration of linen by ultraviolet radiation.  2015

## A burial textile from the ﬁrst century CE in Jerusalem compared to roman textiles in the land of Israel and the Turin Shroud.  2015.

Shamir, Orit.  "[A burial textile from the ﬁrst century CE in Jerusalem compared to roman textiles in the land of Israel and the Turin Shroud](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307702798_A_burial_textile_from_the_first_century_CE_in_Jerusalem_compared_to_roman_textiles_in_the_land_of_Israel_and_the_Turin_Shroud)."  SHS Web of Conferences.  2015.

**Ben Hinnon Valley was one of the main burial sites during second temple:** "The conﬂuence of the Kidron and Ben Hinnom Valleys, south of the Old City of Jerusalem, contains one of Jerusalem’s richest concentrations of rock-hewn tombs. This area, located on the periphery of the village of Silwan, was one of the main burial Necropolis during the Second Temple period, 538 BCE until 70 CE."

**Bodies and ossuaries:** "The burial customs included a primary

burial within loculi and a secondary bone collection in ossuaries. It seems that this custom had been

introduced late in the Second Temple period, probably around the mid-ﬁrst century BC."

**Most fabrices are S-spun, not Z-spun:** "Wool textiles from the Roman period in Israel are usually S-spun. Z-spun textiles comprise only a small proportion of Roman-period textiles recovered in Israel and neighbouring countries, while in Greece and Italy, for example, the Z-spin was the norm [11]. Therefore the wool textile from Akeldama [a cave in Israel] could have been imported. This would indicate that the individual came from a wealthy family. Importing a special and “ﬁne” burial cloth would entail time and expense and would not be done for the common man."

"All the linen textiles from the Land of Israel until the medieval period are S-spun, plain weave tabby. A few wool textiles from the Roman period are Z-spun in both warp and weft (37 out of 826 wool textiles) [54]."

**Linen shrouds are common in Israel:** "The use of wool textile in primary use for burials and shrouds is less common than linen in the Land of Israel and was usually used for shrouds in secondary use. Linen shrouds have been discovered at burials sites in the Land of Israel. Linen shrouds dating from the Roman period have been found also at ‘En Gedi, Gesher Haziv [14], and Jericho – imprints of textiles were found on bones and skulls [15]; the material used was identiﬁed as linen because of an equal number of threads in the warp and the weft. Shrouds were also found at Nahal David and Ze’elim, but the ﬁber material was not speciﬁed in Ref. [16] and we could not examine them because they did not arrive to the Israel National collections."

...

"It is interesting to compare these ﬁnds to the shrouds from the Nabataean burials at ‘En Tamar dated to the Roman period, 2–3th centuries CE. The Nabateans [who lived in northern Arabia and the southern Levant] controlled the Spice routes joining Petra and Gaza northwards to Syria and westwards to the Mediterranean. The shrouds are made of linen, but a small group of them is decorated with narrow wool red bands [21] (Fig. 5)."

"Wool was the most common textiles material in the Roman Period in Israel (900 of 1635, Table 1), where linen was also very popular (662 of 1635, Table 1)."

**Washing the body and wrapping it in a shroud was common:** "Preparation for a Jewish burial consisted mainly of washing the corpse and wrapping it in shrouds [39].  Shrouds were specially-prepared or freshly laundered garments for the purpose of wrapping the corpse.  The Hebrew word for these burial shrouds, takrikim, connotes wrapping and binding more than dressing as is also indicated by Tractate Semahot: “Man may wrap and bind men but not women, but women may wrap and bind both men and women” [40]. In preparation for burial, spices and incense are often placed upon the shroud [41]."

**Jewish law allowed for the dead to buried in mixed fabrics, but none are found:** "Wearing garments of mixed wool and linen – which is called in the Hebrew sources sha’atnez –is forbidden by the Jewish law [22] but it can be used to make shrouds for the deceased [23]. But none of the Jewish shrouds found in the above-mentioned archaeological sites and none of the shrouds made from reused textiles (see below) are made of sha’atnez.  Although thousands of textiles in the Land of Israel have been examined, no one piece of sha’atnez has been recovered from any Roman Jewish site [24]. This is in contrast with the Roman sites in neighboring areas, as for example in Syria at sites such as Dura Europos and Palmyra, and in Coptic Egypt, which have yielded a great deal of textiles made of mixed linen and wool. Yet a few pre-Roman sites in the Land of Israel have yielded sha’atnez textiles: Kuntillat ‘Ajrud (Hurbat Teman) in Sinai dated to the ﬁrst half of the 8th century BCE – the Iron Age II and Wadi ed-Dâliyeh (located 14 km northwest of Jericho) contained artefacts belonged to Samaritan refugees and is dated to the Hellenistic Period. In both cases it was explained as belonging to the High Priest and priests respectively which, according to the Hebrew Bible, was required to wear sha’atnez while serving in the Temple [25]. The almost complete absence of mixed wool and linen (sha’atnez) textiles at non-Jewish sites, such as the Nabatean ones, can be explained by the fact that the textiles in Israel during the Roman Period were produced by Jews and purchased by the non-Jewish population. There is a striking likeness between the Nabatean and Jewish textiles (1–2th centuries CE), including shaded bands and the number of threads per cm [26]. Parenthetically, the absence of sha’atnez in the Turin shroud is not an indication that it was originally weaved for some other purposes, such as a sheet connected with the ritual immersions of the High Priest on Yom Kippurt, Jesus’ tallit (mantle) or tablecloth of the Last Supper as was suggested by some scholars [27] (but there are other indications that it was reused, see below)."

**Wide variety of cloths and pieces used for burial shrouds:** "Shrouds were sometimes made from reused textiles. Most of the shrouds in the Cave of Letters were made from tunics and mantles, usually made of wool, that had been ripped apart for this purpose.  Linen sacks were also in secondary use as shrouds [31]. This kind of burials can be explained by the harsh siege conditions of the Roman army on the Jewish population under the Roman siege. At Khirbet Qazone, a Nabatean cemetery in Jordan dating to the ﬁrst century CE, some of the deceased were found with reused textiles still wrapped around them [32]. At Dura-Europos a covering or a curtain was in secondary use as the wrapping for the deceased person [33]. At Palmyra the corpse were wrapped ﬁrst in several layers of simple cloth in secondary use, usually linen; ﬁnally, a sort of outer decoration made of sumptuous garments cut into strips for sepulchral purposes was arranged in a decorative manner on the wrapped body. This custom explains why most of the textiles found at Palmyra were preserved in bands of different sizes [34]. In Krokodilopolis and Herakleopolis Magna, some of the sheets used as burial wrappings bear extensive darning, evidence that they were previously used in life [35]. In Nubia, shrouds were often made of several pieces of cloth sewn together to produce a sufﬁcient length and width to envelop the body, indicating that the cloths were not especially woven for funerary purposes [36]."

**Textiles, especially Linen, were costly and rare:** "Textiles were too costly to throw away. When a garment had passed the state where patching was no longer possible, it was cut into pieces and either remade into another garment or used for patches [37]. Despite the fact that the Land of Israel was considered an important textile center, there was a chronic shortage of garments in general, and of linen ones in particular. Such linen garments were quite rare and certainly very expensive [38]."

**Jews used shrouds:**

"During the late Second Temple period it became common to spend great sums on expensive shrouds [43]. The rich grew very extravagant in this respect, securing fanciful and costly garments, and establishing a custom which became a burden upon mourners of the middle and poorer classes, who could ill endure the expense and yet desired to show the highest respect for their dead. Thus Rabban Gamaliel inaugurated the custom of using a simple linen shroud for rich and poor alike. It is uncertain whether the reference is to Rabban Gamaliel the Elder, who lived before 70 CE, or (more probably) to his successor Rabban Gamaliel II, of the Jabneh period (second half 1th-second half 2th centuries CE) [44]."

Afterwards, the people followed his example and were also buried in linen garments. Said Rav Papa, “Nowadays, everybody uses even “tsadra” (rough cloth) which costs one zuz (a minimal sum)” [45]. Rabbi Judah the Patriarch [46], who died in the early third century CE, directed that he not be buried with many shrouds. The Jerusalem Talmud explains that the Rabbi was of the opinion that “a person will not come as he left”; thus, he need not worry that his burial garments are appropriate for resurrection. A simple sheet was sufﬁcient and, if he merits a place in the World to Come, he will be dressed appropriately at the proper time. 

Other commentators, in contrast, believed that one’s state at resurrection would be the same as at the time of burial. Rabbi Yohanan is reported to have requested that he be buried in garments that were neither black nor white – so that, whether he ﬁnd himself standing among the righteous or the wicked in the World to Come, he would not be ashamed. Rabbi Yoshaya on the other hand, commanded that he be buried in proper white garments, as he was not ashamed of his righteous deeds. Finally, Rabbi Jeremia is reported to have directed that he be buried with proper garments, sandals and a walking staff.  A burial in garments was also possible: To which kind of corpse does (the law of) “rot” apply? It applies to that which is buried naked, in a sarcophagus of stone or on a ﬂoor or a marble tablet. But one who is buried in his garment or in a cofﬁn of wood or on the ground, here (the law of) “rot” does not apply [47]. One who weaves a “garment for the deceased” (for a speciﬁc individual, after his death), Abbayeh says: “Prohibited (its use for anything else)” and Rava says: “Permitted” [48]. The Talmud also refers to a ﬁne-wool robe covering a corpse [49].

**Turin Shroud much finer threads:** "The Turin shroud has 38.6 threads per cm at the warp and 25.7 threads per cm at the weft which is very high compared to linen textiles manufactured at the Land of Israel which usually have 10–15 threads per cm at the warp and 15–20 threads per cm at the weft "

**Twill is rare in Israel:** "Despite the fact that looms capable of weaving twill existed in this period and even before, twill has not been found in Israel prior to the Roman period. The weave was found in small quantities among wool textiles (32 out of 1635 textiles from Roman period sites) including the Cave of Letters (one item), the Judean Desert caves survey (one item), Masada (13 items, Fig. 6), Mo’a (9 items), Murabba’at (6 items) and Sha’ar Ramon (2 items) [57].  The twill variations are: twill 2/2, twill 1/2 and diamond twill; ... Most of the twills are Z-spun. Twill textiles can be manufactured with three heddles loom which were not in use in Israel. It means that the twills were imported. Herringbone twill textiles are known from Europe and Egypt [59]."

**Contra Flury-Lemberg, rum and fell seams were also found in textiles from the medieval period:**  "Run and fell seams which were used to stitch textiles together were used, according to Flury-Lumberg [60], only during the Roman period, even though they were found also in textiles from the Medieval period as at Kasr al-Yahud from the ninth century CE."

**Plain and tabby weaves were the most common, but twill was stronger:** "Plain weave or tabby was the most common weave for garments and other used including the the shrouds. Twill is a tighter form and thus more able to stand greater wear than tabby but, as stated above, it was found in small quantities in the Land of Israel and was imported."

**Turin shroud probably not manufactured in Israel.:** "The Turin Shroud was probably not manufactured in theLand of Israel neither in the Roman nor in the Medevial period. It may not have been imported in none of these periods because not one textile with the above weaving technique was found in the Land of Israel."

**Side seam stitching also found in medieval period?**  "Run and fell seams which were used to stitch textiles together were used, according to Flury-Lemberg [Flury-Lemberg 2001], only during the Roman period, even though they were found also in textiles from the Medieval period as at Kasr al-Yahud from the ninth century CE [Shamir 2005b]."

## Mechanical and opto-chemical dating of the Turin Shroud, 2015

Giulio Fanti, Pierandrea Malfi, Fabio Crosilla.  2015.  MATEC Web of Conferences
https://www.matec-conferences.org/articles/matecconf/pdf/2015/17/matecconf_wopsas2015_01001.pdf

"The present paper discusses the results obtained using innovative dating methods based on the analysis of mechanical parameters (breaking strength, Young modulus and loss factor) and of optochemical ones (FT-IR and Raman). To obtain mechanical results it was necessary to build a particular cycling-loads machine able to measure the mechanical parameters of single flax fibers 1-3 mm long"

**Dates from mechanical, FT-IR, and Raman Spectroscopy:** "A least squares multi linear regression (MLR) has been applied to the measured mechanical data estimating a TS age equal to 260 AD. Furthermore, two optochemical methods have been applied to test the linen fabric, obtaining a date of 250 BC by a FT-IR ATR analysis and a date of 30 AD by a Raman analysis. These two dates combined with the mechanical result, weighted through their estimated square uncertainty inverses, give a final date of the Turin Shroud of 90 AD ±200 years at 95% confidence level."

**Environmental factors give a certainty of centuries:**  "Notwithstanding that environmental factors, like temperature and humidity, and other factors like contamination with external materials can influence both the mechanical and the opto-chemical parameters of ancient textiles, the methods here adopted show a relatively stable trend if a preselection of fibers, also based on visual inspection and on a particular sampling technique, is done. In fact if a proper shrewdness is taken into account by means of a preliminary selection of the samples also based on microscopic visual inspection, the bias due to environmental effects can be reduced and therefore a rough dating is possible. The data dispersion reported in the correlation coefficients of the resulting equations seems greatly due to environmental factors that obviously increase the variability of the behavior of the linen fibers, but this dispersion is not so high to prevent a rough dating in the range of some centuries."

**Damaged fibers due to humidity are easy to reject:** "Exposition to humidity seems an environmental factor not very influent in the analysis if a proper textile selection is done. This because humidity highly damages the chemical structure, the color and the mechanical behavior of these fibers that therefore are quite simple to recognize and discharge during a preliminary selection."

**Temperatures > 200C can alter mechanical properties of fibers:** "Exposition of flax textiles to relatively high temperature (about 200 °C for some hundreds of seconds) can alter the mechanical properties of the fibers thus producing in some cases like FT-IR, bias of hundreds years coupled with a more brownish coloration. Therefore the proposed dating methods have to take into account, as it has been done, for a possible bias due to temperature effects."

**But fire not enough to affect date:** "In the MMPDM [Mechanical Multi-Parametric Dating Method] the fire effects compatible with the TS features have been estimated to be less than the uncertainty and therefore neglected."

**Heating some shroud fibers to 200C affected the age less than the margin of error:** "The mechanical parameters values measured in correspondence of the TS (glutes area [17]) are reported in the second row of Table 4, Figs. 2 and 3 . Possible bias due to Chambéry fire has been evaluated in advance using Samples A, A1 and A2. To do so, Samples A1 and A2 (see Table 1) have been heated in an oven and tested while Sample A has been assumed as reference specimen (not heated fibers). Sample A1 presents a brownish color level just higher than that of the TS. Corresponding bias has been neglected because smaller than the measurement uncertainty of the mechanical parameters."

**Glue 1mm fibers, give them multiple pull/relax cycles:** "A new micro-cycling machine [12,13] has been designed for the measurement of single fibers extracted from flax fabrics. These single fibers, about 1 mm long have been tabbed on a special self hand-made polyester mask with cyanoacrylate glue and subjected to multiple loading and unloading cycles.  Stresses ranged from zero to 2/3 of the breaking strength with resolution better than about 100 measurement points per cycle. The measured elongation was of 1% with a resolution of 0.1 m; the measured forces ranged from 0 to 0.5 N, with a resolution of 2 N."

**Fibers came from STURP, defects make it easy to tell them apart from modern linen:** "The TS dating have been performed using flax fibers sampled from the TS by STURP members; the first Author has their traceability documents that is also reported in Ref. [14]. For example in the case of the mechanical dating, eight different TS fibers, coming from the “h” Filter (corresponding to a dusts vacuumed from the back of the TS in correspondence of the glutes area) have been recognized as such by the first author among others using a petrographic microscope and a particular technique based on cross-polarization. TS fibers in fact present a greater number of transversal defects (kink bands) than other more recent flax fibers and it is therefore relatively easy to detect them."

**Table 1 lists 16 flax samples ranging from modern times to 3000 to 3500 BC in radiocarbon years:**

**Five methods attempted to test age of flax fibers:** "The data of the 9 samples under test, relative to the parameters [12] Breaking Strength r, “Final” Young Modulus Ef, “Inverse” Young Modulus Ei, “Direct” Loss Factor nd and “Inverse” Loss Factor ni, that were independently analyzed through bi-dimensional relationships with age, are reported in Table 2, Figs. 2 and 3."

**Reduced to only 3 factors that were consistent with known ages:** "For this reason and for mechanical considerations about the physical meaning of the chosen parameters, the number of the parameters has been reduced from five to three, namely Breaking Strength σr, Inverse Young Modulus Ei and Inverse Loss Factor i"

**Mechanical dating puts the shroud at 260AD:** "The result is 260 AD with a standard uncertainty of 137 years. This is compatible with the date of 372 AD reported in Table 4, obtained by the MMPDM. The MLR result is certainly more reliable because of the rejection of the outlier."

**FT-IR calibrated against 11 other linen samples, 3 with fire exposure, fire affect is less than uncertainty:** "Eleven reference flax samples mentioned in Table 1 have been tested, 8 of which have been used for calibration and 3 for testing the fire effects. In the FT-IR method the fire effects compatible with the TS features have been estimated as no negligible and therefore considered as a systematic effect."

"While the fire effects, compatible with the TS features, have been estimated to be less than the uncertainty and therefore neglected. "

**Conclusions and Dates:**  "First, an Opto-Chemical mean date of 140 BC has been obtained. This value has been successively averaged with the Mechanical result, obtaining the most probable date of the TS to be 86 AD ±206 years or better 90 AD ±200 years (having rounded the date to one decade, and the expanded uncertainty to half century). The TS date, preliminarily evaluated in [16] of 33 BC ±250 years, using a rougher method like MMPDM, that is based on the averaged results coming from independent bi-dimensional least squares regression methods, characterized by an higher uncertainty, is compatible with this new date value."

2. FT-IR:  250 BC ±400
3. Raman:  30 AD ±400

## Optical features of flax fibers coming from the Turin Shroud, 2015

Giulio Fanti.  SHS Web of Conferences.  2015.

https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2015/02/shsconf_atsi2014_00004/shsconf_atsi2014_00004.html

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276400494_Optical_features_of_flax_fibers_coming_from_the_Turin_Shroud

Figures 2 and 3 show the difference between image and non-image fibers, including the 22 micrometer thickness of the colorization.

**Ancient flax was beaten, creating defects:** "In the ancient times, according with Pliny the Elder [21]“the stems [...] are dried in the sun, then, once dried, are crushed on a stone with a tow-hammer.” The stalks were beaten and crushed on a stone using speciﬁc tools. This procedure justiﬁes the particular feature of ancient ﬂax ﬁbers that are well distinguishable in PLM from the modern ones because ﬁlled of dislocations. Modern ﬂax ﬁbers in fact are not subjected to this beating procedure that surely increases the number of defects."

**TS Image fibers are corrugated, just like fibers exposed to coronal discharge and lasers:**  "Image-ﬁbers, see Figs. 13,14 and 15 (taken from STURP-1EB tape coming from the right ankle of the dorsal body image), have a corrugated surface that is not typical of TS non-image ﬂax ﬁbers, but that is typical of ﬂax ﬁbers exposed to intense sources of radiation. In fact experimentally colored ﬁbers of ﬂax exposed to Corona Discharge [19], see Fig. 16 and to Excimer Lasers [22], see Fig. 17, show a similar feature.  The PCW [Primary Cell Wall] corrugation can be explained as the result of a SCW shrinking caused by a chemical modiﬁcation that could be related to dehydration, oxidation and/or conjugation produced by intense radiations. This process of SCW [Secondary Cell Wall] shrinking can also be increased by aging and this hypothesis can also help to explain the increasing of the number of dislocations per unit length with age of the ﬂax ﬁbers"

Figures 16 and 17 show modern fibers that were not and were exposed to corona discharge and excimer laser.  Figure  13 and 15 shows an image fiber from the shroud in the same cross-polarized light.

**Oven used to test how hot the shroud was in the 1523 fire:**  "The TS was not exposed to heat sources harder than about 250 C for 5 minutes, 200 C for 30 minutes, 180 C for 60 minutes or 160 C for 240 minutes."  Eric:  But this isn't enough to bolster Ray Roger's argument that there'd be no vanillin loss from the fire.

Figure 20 shows fabrics exposed to different heats and times, vs the shroud.

**Was likely kept in a silver container during 1532 fire:** "As a partial conﬁrmation of the fact that the TS was contained in a silver reliquary when subjected to the Chambéry ﬁre, the ESEM (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope) analysis reported in Fig. 21 shows the presence of a silver particle deposited on a ﬂax ﬁber also in correspondence of the EDAX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis) spectrum."

**Shroud fire damage in 1532 possibly from firery beam falling:**  "Incidentally it must be observed that the shape of the TS holes seem not coherent with drops of melted silver or lead coming from the reliquary, but are congruent with the effects of a ﬁery beam perhaps falling from the church’s roof that broke the reliquary and pierced all the layers of the folded Relic."

**Image is not from pigments:** "Raman and FT-IR analyses conﬁrm some chemical information relative to the TS image-ﬁbers: the image is not made by pigments but is caused by an oxidation, dehydration and conjugation of the polysaccharides PCW [Primary Cell Wall] about 200 nm thick."

**Fibers studied are from STURP:** "Particular thanks to Raymond Rogers and other STURP scientists who kindly furnished samples of the TS taken during 1978 campaign."

## Mechanical Characterization of Linen Fibers: The Turin Shroud Dating, 2017

Giulio Fanti.  International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering.

I only took notes on things I didn't see in the [2015 version](https://www.matec-conferences.org/articles/matecconf/pdf/2015/17/matecconf_wopsas2015_01001.pdf) of this paper.

**Humidity doesn't have much effect:**  "Humidity is an environmental factor not very influential in the analysis if a proper preselection is performed because it highly damages the chemical structure, the color and the mechanical behavior of these fibers so it is quite simple to recognize and discharge the defective samples."

**It's easy to discard heat-damaged fibers:** Relatively high temperature (about 200◦C for some hundreds of seconds) can alter the mechanical properties of the fibers thus potentially producing bias, coupled with a more brownish coloration18 of the fibers. This coloration therefore can help in their discharging during preselection.

**Lots of factors affect aging, but are lower than level of uncertainty:**  The flax fiber’s degradation with time is also accelerated by environmental factors, such as temperature, light, moisture, soil acidity, lichens attacks, molds, mites and rotting. These factors also obviously affect the mechanical properties of the fibers, but it results9,10 that these effects are lower than the uncertainty of very few centuries if the above mentioned proper preselection of the fibers under test is performed.

**1532 Chambery fire was lower than uncertainty:** "A study of the fire effects on flax fibers was performed because the TS was subjected to the Chamb´ery fire in 1,532, but the fire effects resulted lower than the measurement uncertainty and therefore neglected."

**New shroud sample from the wrist area, not in 2015 study:** "In particular the Sample 3EB coming from the wrist area of the frontal image of the TS confirms the previously calculated age of the Relic of 400 A.D. ± 400 years that is incompatible with the radiocarbon age evaluated in Ref. 13. The new evaluated age of the TS of 110 A.D. ±400 years is again compatible with the date of 30–33 A.D., epoch in which the TS was supposed to be used to wrap the corpse of Jesus Christ."

## Uncovering the sources of DNA found on the Turin Shroud, 2015

https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14484

Abstract:  The Turin Shroud is traditionally considered to be the burial cloth in which the body of Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death approximately 2000 years ago. Here, we report the main findings from the analysis of genomic DNA extracted from dust particles vacuumed from parts of the body image and the lateral edge used for radiocarbon dating. Several plant taxa native to the Mediterranean area were identified as well as species with a primary center of origin in Asia, the Middle East or the Americas but introduced in a historical interval later than the Medieval period. Regarding human mitogenome lineages, our analyses detected sequences from multiple subjects of different ethnic origins, which clustered into a number of Western Eurasian haplogroups, including some known to be typical of Western Europe, the Near East, the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian sub-continent. Such diversity does not exclude a Medieval origin in Europe but it would be also compatible with the historic path followed by the Turin Shroud during its presumed journey from the Near East. Furthermore, the results raise the possibility of an Indian manufacture of the linen cloth.

Politics of the radiocarbon dating of the Turin Shroud, 2016

When the four floodlights pointed toward the ceiling were activated, the
Superintendent of Cultural Heritage of Turin asked that the lighting power be
reduced for fear of harm to the Shroud. Riggi later wrote that they ended up
extracting the sample “in a generalized semi-darkness.”

In a conference held in Paris in 1989, both [technician who cut the shroud
Giovanni] Riggi and [textile expert Franco] Testore [present at the trimming]
reported that the sample measured 8.1 cm x 1.6 cm. Both would later give
multiple versions of how much the samples weighed. The trimming from 8.1 cm x
1.6 cm to 7 cm x 1 cm was necessary, according to Riggi, “for the pollution of
the cloth itself with threads of a different nature which even in small amount
could have led to variations in dating, being a later addition.” From: The
Enigma of the Shroud: A Challenge to Science, 1996, p61-62

"What happened next simply beggars belief: to maintain the pretense, Ballestrero
and Tite took the samples into a private area, out of view of all the people in
attendance and of the camera, and put them into vials labeled with numbers.
These vials were then brought out and presented to the representatives of the
three labs. This secrecy gave rise to the allegation, quite 8 absurd on the face
of it, that Tite had conducted some sleight of hand and switched the real Shroud
samples with others of medieval age. There are still quite a few Europeans who
believe to this day that the samples were substituted and the C-14 date that was
later obtained is not from a piece of the Shroud. Loading the vials in private
was a totally unnecessary and ridiculous procedure, another major error on
Gonella's part."

"Not one lab photographed the samples they received properly, i.e. both sides
and with a scale. The samples were examined under a microscope, and a few alien
fibers picked out, but no lab reported anything suspicious"

Gove, who co-invented AMS and whose lab was originally planned to receive a
fragment for dating: "It’s amazing that despite the elaborate planning meeting
held in Turin in 1986, authorities discussed where to take the sample from for
two hours at the time of sample taking. They ended up choosing an area that many
had recommended avoiding and had the required thorough chemical analyses been
performed or had STURP been consulted, the conclusion that the sample was
anomalous might have been made in 1988"

"1988 April. Ted Litherland, who was director of the IsoTrace lab in Toronto and
co-inventor of the AMS method with Harry Gove, commented about the choice of the
area from which the sample was taken, “All the samples came from one corner. Oh
Dear! My God! That’s no way to run a show.”"

## Atomic resolution studies detect new biologic evidences on the Turin Shroud, 2017

De Caro and Fanti

This paper was retracted.  ==TODO==

De Caro 2017 (not 2018, the wiki editor is again clueless) was retracted for political reasons.  Note that the authors did the things that the retraction accuses them of not doing:

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180487

My summary:  

> Researchers, writing in their paper:  "We got the fiber from Barry Schwortz who's with STERA, which came from Rogers' sticky tapes" (paraphrased)
>
> PLOS One:  "We're retracting your paper because you didn't say where you got the fiber or that you were working with STERA."
>
> they're also upset that their sample was too small, when the Catholic church refuses to let people study the shroud any more. I guess we just can't do any science on the pieces we have, huh?



Antonacci 2017
--------------

Problems with the book:

1.  Ant p. 180 says that Rogers's sample being next to a scorch mark explains
    the lack of vanillin. (Ant 180) But Rogers tested for vanillin all over the
    shroud from the "sampling tape’s adhesive!": "No samples from any location
    on the shroud gave the vanillin test" yet "the Raes threads, the Holland
    cloth, and all other medieval linens gave the test for vanillin" (Rogers,
    1.  Antonacci (180, middle) wrongly states, "If vanillin is not present in
        the Shroud's samples and the larger cloth, then it indicates all the
        material is ancient and the same."
2.  Ant p. 176 (middle) "Rogers also fails to understand that his radiocarbon
    samples were on the edge of a water stain." But Benford 2008 figure 15 shows
    the C14 region was entirely outside of the water stain!
3.  Misspelled Acheiropoietas and Montferrat on pg 225.
4.  Explains the Sudarim's date by radiation but doesn't mention the black
    specks would already skew the date forward.

Perhaps Antonacci has a bias against Rogers because in 2002 Rogers published, that because of his Historically Consisent Hypthesis, "Antonacci has done severe damage to the credibility of studies on the Shroud."

## Investigating the color of the blood stains on archaeological cloths: the case of the Shroud of Turin, 2018

The academia.edu version has many differences:  https://www.academia.edu/34290956/Investigating_the_Color_of_the_Blood_on_the_Shroud_of_Turin

==TODO, I haven't read most of this==

> The Shroud is considered one of the most studied archaeological objects in history

> dried blood turns dark brown due to oxidation of oxy-hemoglobin to met-hemoglobin (MetHb) and hemichrome.

An alternate way to keep the blood red besides their UV test:

> Concerning Saponaria officinalis, Rogers and Arnoldi in Ref. [9] wrote: “The warp of ancient linen was protected with starch during weaving and the finished cloth was washed in Saponaria officinalis suds. Saponaria is hemolytic, which could explain why the old blood stains on the cloth are still red. Diane Soran (deceased) of Los Alamos, tested hemolysis on Saponariawashed cloth before we went to Turin. The blood is still red on those 25-year-old samples. Controls are black.” Unfortunately, experimental data and photographs are not available, and the claimed redness of the old blood stains due to Saponaria officinalis cannot be confirmed.

> 30-ns UV laser pulses irradiation produces a slight reddish shift of the color of high-bilirubin blood stains one day after irradiation, but the redness does not persist after four years. On the contrary, continuous-wave (cw) UV irradiation of high-bilirubin blood stains generates a color shift toward the red-yellow that persists over time, as it is still visible and measurable after four years.

## The Medieval Weave.  2019

Hugh Farey.  https://medievalshroud.com/the-medieval-weave/

"Firstly, although it is almost invariably called ‘herringbone’, it is in fact ‘chevron’ weave, where the two sets of ‘ribs’ attached to each ‘spine’ are exactly symmetrical. In true ‘herringbone’ the ribs are slightly off-set."  (see picture)

He quotes Gabriel Vial from 1990:  "So far every example studied – and these have come from Pompeii, Antinoe, Palmyra, Cologne, Dura-Europos – has been radically different from the shroud, both from the point of view of the structure (2/2 twill as opposed to 3/1) and the materials used (wool and silk rather than linen). We have to look to the 16th century to find the first example of linen chevron weaving with a 3/1 twill structure, found in the canvas of a painting in Herentals (Belgium).

Taking into account the constituent elements of any textile (material, structure, warp and weft density, the textile of which the shroud is composed is unlike anything presently known to date prior to the 16th century. (Vial, Gabriel, ‘Shrouded in Mystery’, HALI (The International Magazine of Fine Carpets and Textiles), Issue 49, 1990)"

Doesn't discuss the many ancient examples of twills that require 4 shafts.



## Marino Reweave Presentation.  2019

Marino, Joe.  "[The Invisible Reweave and Other Challenges to the Turin Shroud’s C-14 Medieval Dating: A Review](https://www.academia.edu/40272184/The_Invisible_Reweave_and_Other_Challenges_to_the_Turin_Shrouds_C_14_Medieval_Dating_A_Review)."  2019.

**Textile experts spot reweave:** "Sue took photographs of both the Zurich and uncut C-14 samples to European-trained weaver David Pearson, owner of the French Tailors in Columbus, Ohio. Pearson, who was not told that they were photographs of the Shroud, immediately recognized the disparate weave pattern and differences in thread size, stating "there is no question that there is different material on each side. [i.e. left to right orientation]. […] It is definitely a patch"...  He said that medieval European weavers would typically try to match the original cloth and then hand-stitch approximately ½ inch of new material into the old, such that it was invisible to all but the trained eye. This would ensure the long-term integrity of the material, while maintaining aesthetic consistency throughout the fabric. In addition, this type of detail to repairs would be consistent with the wealth and devotion of the Savoy family, who owned the Shroud at the time.  Sue also sent photos to two other institutions without telling them that they were from the Shroud. A blinded analysis of a photograph of the Zurich C-14 sample, by Thomas Ferguson & Co. Ltd, world-renowned makers of Double Damask Linen, resulted in their perception that the sample was "touched up to prevent unraveling." They further observed, "We have to say that we see the twill pattern clearly on both sides, but still there is something different left versus right." In a third blinded analysis of the Zurich C-14 sample, by Albany International, Louise Harner remarked that “the float is different on either side of the sample. It forms a thick/thin, thick/thin pattern on the right side, whereas the left is much more consistent throughout” (Albany International Research Company, 2000). “Float” is defined as “a length of yarn on the surface of a woven fabric between two consecutive intersections of the yarn with the yarns woven at right angles to it.”

**Rejected from Radiocarbon by Jull:** "The review of our paper was out of the ordinary insofar as the reviewers were revealed to us, and also were all originally directly involved in the specific topic of our paper. Furthermore, five of the reviewers had been directly involved in the 1988 testing. What were the chances that any of these men, each of whom would publicly look bad if our hypothesis were correct, would want to see our paper published? The answer is obvious. Our paper was not accepted. Most intriguing was a comment by the late French C-14 scientist Jacques Evin, who wrote in the review sent to Sue and me: 15) [SLIDE OF EVIN QUOTE FROM RADIOCARBON] The authors, who, for several reasons, are convinced that the shroud is authentic, want to publish an article in Radiocarbon only to introduce a doubt about the dating. All people involved in the sampling and in laboratory analyses, will be very angry with these suspicions turning on so an important mistake or a misconduct [...]. It’s an intriguing comment, and I’m pretty sure he didn’t think we would end up seeing it. "

**Turin won't allow re-examination:**  "On July 20, 2003, we sent a long, detailed letter by “snail mail.” It was basically the same proposal we had submitted in 2000 when church authorities had asked for them. We received a reply from the Cardinal who said, “[A]ll proposals for new examinations of the Shroud are under the exam of a jury of 11 scientists, from which we await the judgment.” But here we are, sixteen years later, still waiting for the jury of scientists to judge."

**Organizer of Dallas conference poses online as the cardinal of Turin:** "we had found out that the organizer, posing online as the Cardinal of Turin, had sent an email to Rogers’ widow asking her to send back to Turin any leftover samples he had, we decided not even to submit the paper -- we were concerned that the organizer might pilfer some of our material."

**Gove says Michael Tite worried about getting material from a patch:**  "Tite [the overseer of the testing] felt there should be a textile expert present, if samples were to be taken, to make sure that we were getting a piece of cloth from the main body of the shroud on which the image was imprinted and not a rewoven area or a patch (my italics) (Gove 1996:90). "

**Vial warned the edge may be a patch:** "Vial had no particular advice to give, limiting himself to suggesting that the pieces should be taken from the side in order not to damage the image. According to rumors that were current in France, Vial tried in vain to warn those present that the selected area could well have been a patch and not a part of the original Shroud (Petrosillo and Marinelli, 1996:61)."

**McCrone's Madder Rose could be from repair:**  Maloney wrote:  "There is now a new way of looking at the presence of that madder rose. Although this is some distance from the “Raes Corner” such trace amounts can now be conjectured to explain the dye that was used, along with the aluminum mordant and the gum arabic as a binder to create the wash to finish the re-weave. Thus, it may now be seen not as a contaminant from an artist’s studio, but rather a contaminant from the weaver’s workshop. "

## The Carbon Dating of the Shroud is Explained by Neutron Absorption.  2020

https://0201.nccdn.net/1_2/000/000/0d8/da1/the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-is-explained-by-neutron-absorpti.pdf.

This is an abridged version of a 38 page paper:  https://0201.nccdn.net/1_2/000/000/17b/b25/understanding-the-1988-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud.pdf

1) two of the three laboratories obtained statistically different dates, 
2) the carbon date is different for different locations on the cloth increasing about 36 years per cm (91 years per inch) as the sample location moves further from the bottom of the cloth, and 
3) the probability of obtaining a variation of the dates for the 1988 Shroud samples at least as large as was obtained is only 1.4%, which is below the usual acceptance criteria of 5.0%. 

"Based on MCNP nuclear analysis computer calculations, to cause this date shift at the 1988 sample location would require 2 x 1018 neutrons be emitted from the body."

"This date is also consistent with nuclear analysis computer calculations based on the neutron absorption hypothesis, assuming that the Sudarium was placed at a reasonable location on the side bench in the tomb."

Figure 3 shows the neutrons per area of body.

**Arbitrary placement of the Sudarium to get a 700AD date:**  "The Sudarium of Oviedo is believed by many to be the face cloth of Jesus. It has been carbon dated to about 700 AD, in excellent agreement with the date distribution calculated in MCNP, as shown in Figure 20"



## Do gold particles from the Turin Shroud indicate its presence in the Middle East during the Byzantine Empire?

They determined composition via "Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence analysis."

"the composition of gold alloy micro-particles vacuumed at various times from the Turin Shroud are compared with that of gold Byzantine coins minted during the VII–XIII century."

"many samples of gold-silver alloy possibly containing copper residual similar to the famous Byzantine Electrum have been detected. It is well known that the Electrum gold-silver alloy is not frequent in the gold coinage of ancient time. The presence of this alloy can be considered typical of the Byzantine Empire"

The results are "compatible with the Shroud's presence in the Byzantine Empire in the period up to 1204 A.D., as many historical clues indicate."

## Gold and Silver Particles on the Turin Shroud, Studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Elemental Analysis

Lucotte, Gérard.  "[Gold and Silver Particles on the Turin Shroud, Studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Elemental Analysis](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=120356)."  Archaeological Discovery.  2022.

"We have studied by optical microscopy and by SEM-EDX some metallic particles of gold and silver adhering to a sample of the Turin Shroud. A total number of eighteen particles (and sub-particles) containing these two elements were characterized in details. Three of them (e49, b22 and h28-0) are parts of gold scales, and six (l38-1, 2, 3, 4, 7’ and 12) are micro-grains of a gold powder. The three a23-1, 2 and 3 sub-particles are the metallic parts of a spot of painting. The e27 particle (of electrum) is possibly some part of a coin of a Byzantine money; possibly also, the m10 particle could be parts of a billion (a coin of money used during the Roman Antiquity)."

**Looked at Giovani Riggi di Numana's sticky tapes:**  "Giovani Riggi di Numana took some samples and dusts of the TS (Riggi di Numana, 1988) at areas corresponding to hands, face (a 1978 sample taken from the face area was deposited by him on a special sticky-tape), feet, buttlocks and the 14C area. We had access to this sticky-tape, cut up in a triangular form"

**Used optical and electron microscope** "All the particles described here were studied by optical microscopy and by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) – EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray) analysis."

**Electron microscope had an addon to do elemental analysis:** "Elemental analysis for each particle were realised by EDX, this SEM microscope being equipped with a Bruker probe AXS-EDX (The system analysis is PGT: spirit Model, of Princeton Gamma Technology)."

**E27 Byzantine particle:**  "By its aspect and composition, the e27 particle is probably that of electrum, a natural metal that was used to make the earliest metal coins (dating back at least the 3rd millennium BC in Egypt)."

"The e27 particle is compounded of electrum; this sort of particle could be some part of a coin of Byzantine money (according to Fanti & Furlan, 2019)."

**M10 Roman particle:**   In the same way, the m10 particle, of a copper/silver alloy, with lead traces, could be part of a billion (a money coin used during the Roman Antiquity).

**Other particles part of decorations:** "So, only a minor proportion (2 on 18) of TS particles containing gold and/or silver could correspond to parts of coins of moneys. Most of the particles and sub-particles I found on the TS were parts of scales of gold leaf and powders that were used for some sacralised and decorative reasons."

## X-ray Dating of a Turin Shroud’s Linen Sample, 2022

https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/5/2/47/htm
Heritage.

A follow-up to this 2019 paper where the other linen samples were dated but not the shroud:  https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9408/2/4/171/htm

### Overview

They took a 0.5 mm × 1 mm linen thread near the Raes sample and applied Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) to measure its structural degradation.  They compared it to a linen sample from a cloth from 55-74AD from the siege of Masada.

Assumes the shroud was kept at 20-22.5C and 55 to 75% humidity from 1AD to 1300AD.  **To date to the 13th century of the 1988 carbon date, it would need to have been kept at the hottest temperatures on earth for seven centuries.**

"Our work showed that when the ancient fabrics are preserved by environmental contamination—i.e., when they were kept in the tombs where they were found—X-ray and 14C dating agree well ."

### Methods

WAXS is the same thing as X-ray crystallography and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD).  It's used to determine the crystallinity of polymers as well as the chemical composition of films.

They compared:

1. New bleached fabric.
2. Egyptian fabric carbon dated to 544-605 AD.
3. Fabric from the siege of Masada in Israel, carbon dated to 55-74 AD.
4. Egyptian fabric carbon dated to 3500-3000 BC
5. Shroud fiber near the Raes sample.

### Chain Breaks

"the increase in the number of Chain Breaks (*CB*), is the main mechanism of cellulose degradation. "

"The natural aging process that degrades cellulose over thousands of years can be accelerated in suitable ovens by increasing the temperature to the maximum number of *CB* within a few thousand hours"

### Results

Figure 2 shows a good correlation between c14 age and x-ray age above 9 n/m

"Thus, relative humidity is less important than the room temperature in affecting natural aging of cellulose. Nevertheless, high humidity promotes new life: molds, fungi, bacteria, insects, etc., which are more effective at destroying cellulose with respect to natural aging due to the action of the room temperature. Therefore, ancient linen fabric are, usually, only well preserved in semi-desert or desert climates, as for the linen samples found in the tombs of the mummies analyzed in."

"In particular, the WAXS analysis presented here, for the natural aging of the cellulose in the linen of a TS sample, allows us to conclude that it is very probable that the TS is a relic of about 20 centuries old, even if we only have European historical documentation for the last seven centuries."

**Not affected by fire:**  "we measured the WAXS maps of linen samples before and after exposure to a temperature of 200 °C in an oven for half an hour, without any control of the relative humidity, which became very low during the fabric’s exposure at these temperatures, as happens in real accidental fires. After this thermal treatment, the WAXS map of the samples was unaltered"  Figure 4 illustrates this. 

"In particular, detailed experimental tests about the yellowing of the linen have demonstrated that a few minutes at a temperature of 200 °C could be enough to cancel out the TS image"

**Temperature estimates:**  "in order for the TS fabric to be about 20 centuries old, it should have necessarily been kept at an average secular temperature of about 22.5 ± 0.5 °C and an average relative humidity of 55 ± 5% for 13 centuries preceding the XIV century."

**Image would be gone if it wasn't moved north to Europe:**  "since X-ray dating indicates that the TS is older than its seven centuries of European history, we can also argue that it was fortunate that the TS was carried to Europe seven centuries ago. Indeed, our analysis has shown that, from the XIV century until today, the natural aging of the cellulose of the TS linen has been very low, due to the low secular European average room temperatures, thereby preventing the TS body image from fully disappearing, which would have happened at an average secular room temperature of 22.5 °C."

Joe Marino. https://www.academia.edu/90785257/APPENDIX_TO_Raymond_Rogers_Communications_to_the_Shroud_Science_Group_on_the_Anomalous_Nature_of_the_C_14_Corner

"Rogers’ own attempts to contact Turin were all met with silence."

**Radiocarbon corner does not fluoresce:** "The main non-image area of the Shroud fluoresces, as you can see in the upper right part of the photograph. Scorches, water stains, and image do not fluoresce in the visible range of light. The photograph was taken in 1978; therefore, the unfortunate radiocarbon sample had not yet been cut out of the cloth. The area cut in 1988 was immediately above the small, white, triangular area. That white triangle is where the Raes sample was cut in 1973. Notice that the entire area above the Raes sample and along the seam is darker than the main part of the cloth. IT DOES NOT FLUORESCE. That is NOT a shadow. Its chemical composition is different from the Shroud. That is exactly the area sampled for the 1988 dating fiasco."

**Flury-Lemberg only did visual examination:** "The situation is almost that bad, and Fury-Lemberg's claims are all based on visual examination. The chemical properties of the area from which the radiocarbon sample was cut were not considered or tested, and the ultraviolet 5 photographs from 1978 were not consulted. The radiocarbon area is outstandingly different from the rest of the cloth. That is a fact: it has nothing to do with whether or not certain terminology applies or what Flury-Lemberg either knows or does not know about Medieval textile technology. No assumptions about technology need be made to prove that the area in question is anomalous. Without adequate testing, she was fooled. That lack of careful characterization of the sample has made a laughing stock of the Shroud. Most of the world has all of the "proof” it needs to label the Shroud as a Medieval hoax, and her book certainly seems to confirm those beliefs. "

**He gave Al Adler the thread used for dating:** "Number 12 was given to Al Adler. It was a good, long, colored warp thread. I have been told that it was used for an unauthorized attempt at dating. Can anyone comment 9 on that? I had sworn that none of the samples would be used for dating, and all members of STURP were aware of this legal document. Several conflicting claims have been made."

**Rogers found pentose in Raes samples back in 1980:** "Then, while reviewing my notebook and notes, I noticed that on 27-28 March 1980 I did some testing for pentose sugars on Raes and Shroud samples. STURP was gathered at the Air Force Academy to run tests on the tape samples, Zina thread (which had mysteriously disappeared from its package), and Raes samples. I had hypothesized that it might be possible to detect the glycosidic sugars from S. officinalis on the Shroud, which would prove ancient technology for the linen. I used Bial's reagent (300 mg orcinol, 100 ml con. HCI, and 0.25 ml 10% ferric 11 chloride). It did not perform as claimed in the literature; however, when diluted 1: 1 with water, it gave a test with furfural and authentic pentoses. At the time, we did not know there was a large difference between the Raes sample and the main part of the Shroud: considerable confusion resulted. I am still trying to straighten it out. The Bial's test made me very confused, and we did not come to any final decision regarding the presence of pentose sugars on the Shroud. The facts were that I got some positive and some negative tests on Raes sample fibers. Gum Arabic will hydrolyze in HCI to give arabinose, a pentose sugar. Gum Arabic on the Raes fibers would ultimately give a positive test in Bial's reagent.  Unfortunately, I did not attempt to construct alternate hypotheses, and I didn't pay enough attention to the results."

**No response from Turin:** "It is highly unlikely that we could obtain additional samples from the radiocarbon area. I cannot get responses from any of the persons in Turin who have access to samples."

**John Brown received his samples from Rogers:**  "Raes #7 and #14 have been sent to Prof. John Brown, a materials scientist recently retired from Georgia Tech. He is checking my analyses by independent methods. Too bad the persons who "authenticated" the radiocarbon sample in 1988 have not been willing to have their samples and conclusions tested. That is not ethical scientific method."

**Rogers was given 14 Raes threads by Gonella:** "I was given 14 threads by Prof. Gonella, as you can see in the record photograph I sent you --- not 20 as you said 23 October. The record photograph was taken to prove (in court, if necessary) what I had been given: it was not intended to be great art or achieve technical perfection. My reasons for believing that those 14 yarn segments came from the Raes sample are the following: 1) Prof. Luigi Gonella (at that time the Cardinal's scientific advisor) told me they were from the Raes sample, and 2) their cotton content, the variety of cotton, and the textile characteristics agree with those reported by Gilbert Raes in 1973. I believe that the evidence for the sample's validity is much stronger than a supposition based on appearances.  If you doubt the provenience, you should question Prof. Gonella."

**Raes threads are the same:** "All of the nominal Raes threads I have sampled have the same chemical composition: they appear to prove a homogeneous sample population."

**Rogers suspects possible sample switching:** "Whatever we may find about sample switching (which would not surprise me), the fact remains that before the nominal radiocarbon sample was cut, the area was anomalous. Perhaps the sample(s) submitted to the dating laboratories were not taken from the cut section. I cannot address that claim; however, I can provide a significant amount of information that strongly suggests that the area sampled was invalid for dating. It would not matter that a spurious sample was substituted: the date on a true sample taken from the sampling area would have been incorrect for the age of the main part of the cloth."

**Cotton almost unknown in Europe until about 1350:** "The cotton is important. Cotton was almost unknown in Europe until about AD 1350, when "there was widespread belief that it was the fleece of miniature sheep that lived in trees." Crusaders helped spread knowledge of cotton through Europe. There were still legal disputes over whether cotton was a kind of linen as late as AD 1631."

**Raes thought the cotton was modern:** "We had been puzzled by the Raes report at the time of the 1978 STURP observations in Turin. We could not find more than traces of cotton on the cloth, and according to Raes' criteria, it was all modern. The Shroud appeared to be pure linen."

**STURP not consulted about sampling:** "None of the STURP members who had made direct observations on the cloth were consulted with regard to valid sampling areas. I consider the sampling operation to be unconscionable."

**Cotton in one part of Raes sapmle:** "Raes and Vial did not find cotton in Raes Part II, the side adjoining the side strip. They both found cotton in Part I, the part nearest the image. I found cotton in all of the Raes threads I dissected and analyzed. Isn't it a clue that there is a difference between that area and the Shroud? "

**Asks if Vial disected any threads:** "Did Vial dissect any threads to determine whether there were cotton fibers in the centers (cores) of the threads? How many?"

**Garza-Valdes did no chemical analysis:** "Garza-Valdes published photomicrographs of fibers from the adjoining radiocarbon area that showed the same type of coating. He did no chemistry on the fibers. Do we learn all we need to know just by looking at something? "

**Rogers can't see invisible reweave:** "I agree that do not see any evidence for an "invisible" (or French) reweave by observations with reflected light"

**Heterogeneous yarn shows shroud is ancient, not medieval:** "The fact that different yarn batches in the Shroud show different amounts of fluorescence is important. Differences in fluorescence prove differences in chemical composition. The yarn used to weave the Shroud was not one homogeneous batch, and the entire cloth was not bleached at the same time by the same process. This proves it was not produced in the "bleach fields" of the Low Countries during or after the Middle Ages. It has the properties of ancient linen."

**Cloth may have been patched before coming to Europe:** "Taken all together, the evidence for an invalid radiocarbon sample is overwhelming. The dye/gum/mordant system was in common use in the Near East during the time indicated by the radiocarbon analyses (AD 1260-1390). It was not used in Europe at that time. The cotton of that type was common in the Near East at that time: it was almost unknown in Europe. I am beginning to believe that the cloth was patched in the area still held by the Templars at about the time of the fall of Acre (AD 1291). What evidence do we have that such a hypothesis can be rejected?"

**Starch is not enough to change the date:** "A very large amount of starch, used by the nuns, would have changed the apparent age of the cloth, making it appear much more recent. There is not enough starch on the cloth to have had a significant effect. It is there only in a trace amount."

**Turin never did a rigorous study on repair:** "I don't want to get into this argument, but I do want to question the credibility of the statement from Turin that there is no patch, reweave, or whatever you want to call it. They have never done a rigorous study of anything, and their observations on the cloth have been no exception. Has anyone seen any chemical tests or microscopy from them? I haven't. Without at least that kind of observation their statements mean nothing. If an "invisible" reweave had been put into the cloth, its objective would be to fool the viewer. If there is a reweave there, the weaver was successful: the "experts" couldn't see it."

**Problems with Turin:** "I would remind you that the diocese of Turin holds most of my original tape samples. Why can't they provide samples? Why can't they provide samples from the 2002 "restoration"? Why can't they get fibers from the threads Baima Bollone cut in 1978? The cardinal's scientific advisor told me (I saved the message) that even he did not have access to my samples. Why?"



## Medieval Artists, Anachronisms and the Shroud of Turin, 2022.

Pam Moon.  "[Medieval Artists, Anachronisms and the Shroud of Turin](https://www.academia.edu/91074529/Medieval_Artists_Anachronisms_and_the_Shroud_of_Turin)."  2022.

**No concept of negative image:** "Whilst camera obscura was widely known in the Middle Ages, the oldest surviving photographic negative plate and positive image is *The View from the Window at Le Gras*, dating from 1826 to 1827, below.  The medieval Shroud artist would not know what photography was, so they could not have had the foresight to include its properties in their image."

**No concept of 3D heightmap:** "Our medieval artist could not have conceived of 3D imagery, so they could not have known why they had to drape their picture over a three dimensional figure to create the three-dimensional effect."

**Anachronisms, time travel:** "John Cook, a teacher of religious education at a Catholic secondary school in England comments that if the Shroud of Turin was created by a medieval forger they have been a Time Traveller like Dr. Who, with the Tardis. The artist would need to go back and forth in time to ensure their creation was future proofed for inventions unheard of in the Middle Ages"

"A prochronism is an ‘anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time.’ To demonstrate the prochronism surrounding the arguments for the medieval creation of the Shroud, the Thamar image is reproduced below, with the Shroud Face and various 19th and 20th century inventions inserted: Secondo Pia’s camera, a VP8 image analyser, a laptop using photoshop and an oven. A copy of Gray’s Anatomy14 provides some medical expertise. The anachronism is obvious. Researchers in the creation of the Shroud in the Middle Ages should utilise information and technology only available in the Middle Ages. They need to dispose of photographs, 3D imagery, computers and ovens. And rid their minds of all knowledge of them. However, as it is impossible to forget what has been seen and used, this is improbable. Shroud sceptics are not imagining themselves back into the medieval mind and consequently they are expecting skills which would be inconceivable for medieval artists."

"For those who believe the Shroud of Turin wrapped Jesus of Nazareth, the Bible offers an explanation why the Shroud keeps pace with every new scientific discovery."

But a commenter questions this majority view in the comments.

**Failed reproduction attempts:** "Believers in the medieval Shroud have used various techniques to attempt to replicate it. Luigi Garlaschelli used acid and an oven (see below, compared with the black and white Shroud image);10 Colin Berry, a technique with flour and an oven.11 Gary Vikan used a combination of tannin (tea) and ferrous sulphate and then admits to photoshopping his image.12 Hugh Farey has experimented with many different chemicals, eliminating many possible agents in his research.13 He has not yet discovered a satisfactory one. All the above are dependent on computer technology. Their finished results do not have the complexity or the beauty of the Shroud of Turin. They do not have the anatomical accuracy. Also, they are copying an existing image, not creating anything original, unlike the alleged medieval genius. "

**Purchased by Savoys in 1453, transfered to Chambery and Turin in 1578:** "However, matters took a different turn in 1453, when, after a series of events worthy of a historical novel, the Duke of Savoy illegally purchased the Shroud, invalidating all previous acts of censorship. When it was transferred to Chambéry and then, in 1578, to Turin—the two capitals of the Duchy of Savoy that later became the Kingdom of Italy—the relic became the most precious religious object of the sovereign family."

## The Shroud of Turin:  Anything Left to Say?

Nicolotti, Andrea.  "[The Shroud of Turin:  Anything Left to Say?](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/the-shroud-of-turin-anything-left-to-say/)." Biblical  Archaeology.  2022.

**Most medieval historians consider shroud a fake:**  "There are two irreconcilable positions on the authenticity of the Shroud: The camp of sindonologists assert the relic’s authenticity, and the other side insists the Shroud is a pious medieval forgery. The overwhelming majority of scholars has supported the latter view, while the former has always enjoyed support in religious circles as well as a great deal of coverage by media outlets, always hungry to report on the supernatural and mysterious."

[P]rofessional historians and archaeologists—most of whom consider the Shroud to be a medieval artifact—prefer to keep their distance from such a controversial subject. As a result, the Shroud is absent from history textbooks and studies of ancient or medieval Christianity or Christian archaeology. It remains a disputed object that scholars prefer to ignore. Most books on the Shroud either have copied from each other or are shaped by devotional interests. Their authors usually lack sufficient training in historical-critical methods, and their coverage of historical and archaeological aspects is insufficient.

BPA = Bloodstains Pattern Analysis.

**Abstract:** "An investigation into the arm and body position required to obtain the blood pattern visible in the image of the Shroud of Turin was performed using a living volunteer. The two short rivulets on the back of the left hand of the Shroud are only consistent with a standing subject with arms at a ca 45° angle. This angle is different from that necessary for the forearm stains, which require nearly vertical arms for a standing subject. The BPA of blood visible on the frontal side of the chest (the lance wound) shows that the Shroud represents the bleeding in a realistic manner for a standing position while the stains at the back—of a supposed postmortem bleeding from the same wound for a supine corpse—are totally unrealistic. Simulation of bleeding from the nail wounds contacting wood surfaces yielded unclear results."

**Cites McCrone:**  Cites two of Heller's papers and four of McCrone's papers suggesting paint is a valid alternative explanation to blood, as if the debate isn't settled.

**Previous work:** "French physician Pierre Barbet (12–14) examined the two short rivulets which are visible on the back of the left hand. Assuming that blood should drip vertically, he calculated that the nailed arms of the crucified man would have formed an angle of 35 degrees (assuming 0° for a horizontal and 90° for a vertical arm) and experimentally confirmed these figures by nailing human corpses to a homemade cross.  As there is two slightly divergent trickles on the back of the hand, he assumed that the crucified person had changed his position—and therefore the arms’ angle—during the torture of the crucifixion."

"Ricci (15) later speculated that the whole upper part of the body also had to vary its position to account for the blood flow on the forearms. Zugibe (16) suggested that the body was washed before being wrapped into the shroud, and that all blood rivulets come from postmortem oozing. Bevilacqua et al. (17) proposed that the blood on the forearms originated not on the cross, but when the nails were pulled out, and the body was not washed. A number of papers have been published on the various issues of the crucifixion, such as the exact cause of death of a condemned person or the nailing position (18,19). In relation to the Shroud, Lavoie (20) experimentally demonstrated that a blood clot could leave a print on a cloth only if the contact takes place within 1–2.5 h, depending on the humidity. The same Author, tracing the Shrouds blood rivulets onto paper and wrapping it around a real body, was not able to find a natural explanation for their shape and position. Other experimental tests to clarify the formation of the peculiar e-shaped blood flow on the forehead of the image have been performed by Svensson (21)."

**Did not investigate crown of thorns or foot wounds:** "The alleged wounds from the crown of thorns on head and forehead, as well as those on the feet, were not investigated in the present study."

**The Experiments they performed:**

"In these experiments, BPA was performed: 

1. To simulate bleeding in contact with a wood surface, like the patibulum, in order to investigate the shape of the nail wound on the hand and the two short rivulets. 
2. On a standing subject, with blood trickling down from the back of the left hand toward the forearm, in order to investigate the blood pattern at different arm-to-body angles in a crucified individual. 
3. On a supine subject, with hands on the groin, to verify the likeliness of a postmortem flow. 
4. On the short rivulets visible on the back of the left hand in the Shroud of Turin. 
5. On the blood stain under the so-called spear wound, at the right side of the torso of the “Man of the Shroud.” 
6. On the blood stains present in the lumbar region of the Shroud (commonly called “belt of blood”), generally considered the result of a postmortem bleeding from the chest wound when the subject was laying horizontally after the removal from the cross. (Fig. 1b) (24)"

In experiments 2, 3, and 4, whole human blood was used. According to the guidelines for human blood transfusion, the sample had been provided by a volunteer one week before the experiments; it had been stored—additioned with citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) as an anticoagulant and saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) as preservative—at a medical laboratory at +5°C and brought to human body temperature just before use"

In experiments 1, 5, and 6, synthetic blood (25) was used for convenience. Preliminary tests confirmed that the behavior of whole human blood and synthetic blood were identical, and that the results of the experiments were super imposable."

**Zero degrees is arms stretched wide, 90 degrees is arms straight up:** "A ballistic angle finder was used, measuring the arm-body (or forearm-body) angle of a standing subject from 0° (arm parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the body) to 90° (vertical arm)."

**Test 2:  Forearm blood on cross:** "All the experiments performed clearly demonstrate that the angle between the arm and the body must be greater than 80° and smaller than 100° in order for the rivulets to flow from the wrist toward the elbow on the outer part of the forearm, as it appears on the Shroud... Similar results are obtained for all the different locations of the nail exit point (A,B,C)."

My summary:  Arm must be almost straight up for the forearm blood to flow from the wrist toward the elbow.

**Test 3:  Forearm blood when laying on back:** "The volunteer was lying in a supine position on a horizontal surface, his hands overlapping his groin (left hand on top). The end of the cannula was again attached to the back of his left hand, and a small amount of blood was let drip from the transfusion bag."

"The experiment was repeated after the surface on which the volunteer was lying had been tilted 5° both clockwise and counterclockwise. For each inclination, two sets of tests have been performed: one with the volunteer completely supine, and one in a flexed position with the head partially raised and his knees bent."

"When the volunteer was in these positions, the blood movement never matched the Shroud. Instead the flow was parallel to the forearm for a few centimeters before dripping toward the lateral or medial side of the forearm. The rivulets also never ran at an angle comparable with the two shorter stains located on the back of the left hand of the Shroud."

**Test 4:  Back of hand wrist wound:**  "The distal rivulet on the Shroud appears to flow with an angle of 40°, while the proximal runs at 50°"

"It was noted initially that the rivulets obtained during the experiments appear longer than the ones recorded on the Shroud, as they extend to the elbow of the volunteer and also generally change direction near the ulnar epiphysis"

"Thus, as shown in Table 1, to obtain a rivulet/forearm mid-line angle of 40° as on the Shroud, forearm/body angle of the crucified man should be approximately 50°. To observe a rivulet/forearm mid-line angle of 50°, as for the proximal rivulet on the Shroud, the forearm/body angle should be approximately 45°, as can be deduced from the two experiments at 40° and 50° (that, respectively, created a rivulet angle of 63° and 39°: Figs. 6a and 6b)."

"In addition, the data in Table 1 closely resemble the findings of the French physician Barbet (12–14), who calculated on a real corpse a forearm slant of ca 35°. For his experiments, he nailed a corpse, with the arms in a horizontal position (0°), to a cross, which was resting flat on the floor."

**Test 5:  Chest wound:**  "BPA [blood pattern analysis] of the spear wound on the chest was performed as follows: a sponge with the same dimensions (cm 6.5 9 2.5 9 3.5) as the wound, attached to a long handle, was soaked in synthetic blood and then attached to the corresponding area on a mannequin torso. (Fig. 7) When the mannequin was in a standing position, vertical rivulets flow only on the front of the torso, in a direction congruent with the Shroud image. These findings seems to be consistent with the general interpretation that the Man of the Shroud was pierced with the spear while he was hanging from the cross. However, the rivulets obtained during the experiment run independently, without creating a large, filled stain as seen in the Shroud."

**Test 6:  Lumbar:**  "This test was performed using the same process as in experiment number 5, but with the mannequin torso lying on a flat surface covered with fabric. The experiment was repeated after the surface on which it was lying had been tilted 5° both clockwise and counterclockwise (See Fig. 8a,b). The rivulets from the chest wound flow sideways and posteriorly to the scapular region, where they create a single large pool absorbed by the fabric and a corresponding imprint on the body (Fig. 8b). The general pattern is therefore rather different from the Shroud of Turin, where it is possible to recognize the so called “blood belt” as multiple winding lines across the lumbar region (Fig. 1b)."

My summary:  Blood from the chest wound on a horizontal mannequin runs straight down and doesn't go to the back.  When done on a mannequin lying flat, it runs around to the upper back.  On the shroud, the "blood belt" appears on the lower back.

**Conclusion** "The inconsistencies identified by the authors seem not only to point against their own reality, but against the authenticity of the Shroud itself, suggesting that the Turin linen was an artistic or “didactic” representation from the XIV century. This new Bloodstain Pattern Analysis supports the historical records (27), the radiocarbon dating (1), and the chemical analysis (6–11) [Heller+Adler, McCrone]."

**My own comments**

The blood flow on the man's right arm on the shroud image (left side of the shroud) looks like the arm would be raised up at 45 degrees and flowed straight down from there.  The blood on the right arm looks like it just followed the path of the arm.

I should include a picture of the blood with arrows.

Look at figure 6 in the paper and compare it to the wrist wound on the shroud  -- it's a close match.

## Evaluation of "A BPA Approach to the Shroud of Turin"

Robert Rucker.  https://www.shroudresearch.net/Evaluation-of-A-BPA-Approach-to-the-Shroud-of-Turin--Rev-0.pdf

Reviewed by some biomedical and forensics people.

**Hard to simulate:**  " Even if all details of a person’s crucifixion, transport, and burial were known, a human body and its blood flow during and after crucifixion would still be extremely difficult to simulate correctly. It would probably require real blood, without an anticoagulant, flowing over real human skin, both in the condition that they would be in during and after crucifixion. The flow rate of the blood must be correctly simulated. The effects of dehydration, sweat, dirt, and swelling would also have to be properly simulated. Crucifixion would probably cause severe dehydration, which would significantly affect blood viscosity and coagulation rates. All these things would have to be known to properly model the situation. And the orientation of all parts of the body during crucifixion, transport, and burial would have to be known and simulated. Due to these extreme difficulties, any attempt to simulate the conditions of a body and its blood flow during and after crucifixion must be very approximate. "

**Problems:**

1. "Synthetic blood or human blood containing an anticoagulant and a preservative would not have the same viscosity or flow behavior as human blood without an anticoagulant or dilution by a preservative. The blood used in the experiments appears to be much too runny. The evidence on the Shroud (Figure 1) indicates that the real blood, due to crucifixion and without an anticoagulant, is much more viscous (Ref. 2) than the blood used in the experiments (Figure 7 of Ref. 1). 
2. Blood flow on human skin containing pores, hair, wrinkles, and swelling as well as the products of crucifixion such as sweat, dirt, and dried blood products would probably not flow the same as on the clean smooth plastic of the mannequin. This should especially apply to the point at which blood would flow or drip off skin compared to plastic. 
3. The blood flow rates were not the same. Compressing a sponge onto the side of a plastic mannequin, with the blood containing an anticoagulant and a preservative, would not produce the same flow rate as a spear thrust into the side of a dead man, with the blood not containing an anticoagulant or preservative. 
4. The angles were not correct. A hand flat on a table does not simulate a hand in a vertical position, and a person standing up probably does not simulate the shape of a person’s body during crucifixion. 
5. Regarding the nail through the wrist, only blood flow from the back or exit wound was considered. Blood flow from the front or entrance wound was not considered. 
6. The plastic mannequin torso had no arms, whereas the body as it was wrapped in the Shroud in the horizontal position had bare arms next to the side wound. The arms could have affected the blood flow from the side wound. 
7. Experiments were only performed on the blood flow from the back of the left hand and from the side wound. Experiments were not performed on blood flow from the front of the left hand, the head, the feet, or the scourge marks. 4 
8. The alleged discrepancies assume that the blood stains that show on the forearm were due to bleeding from the back (exit) wounds at the wrists, and that the blood stains on the lower back were due to bleeding from the side wound."

## Answer to the article "A BPA Approach to the Shroud of Turin."  2018.

Hermosilla, Alfonso Sánchez.  https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Hermosilla%20EN.pdf

Hermosilla is a forensic doctor and a forensic anthropologist.

"First of all, neither author is a forensic physician, so they lack the experience and knowledge necessary to successfully deal with any kind of investigation with human blood stains"

But Borrini's university [page](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-science/school-of-biological-and-environmental-sciences/matteo-borrini) says he has BPA and forensic anthropology training.  And dozens of publications in forensics journals.

**Arm hair:** " the voluntary subject on which the experiment was performed had no hair on the skin of the forearms, at least this is what can be seen in the photographs of the article, while the Man of the Shroud maybe had it or not. We do not have scientific data on this point. But if he had them, the capillary stems are obstacles to the passage of any fluid, modifying its trajectory. This fact was not taken into consideration."

**Agitation.  Cold, anticoagulated blood:** "The experiment was conducted with human blood from a donor, anticoagulated and kept cold, and flows through the needle of a cannula, while the “volunteer” is immobile. But he does not have living blood flowing from an open wound and a pulsating heartbeat, and he is not even a person moving, fighting for a restless and agitated breathing. It is clearly seen that such agitated movement to achieve a breath while nailed to a cross must have happened in the case of the Man of the Shroud. "

"The physical qualities of anticoagulated blood are very different from those of nonanticoagulated live blood, in particular its viscosity and surface tension, that is to say that its behaviour as a fluid is very different in both cases. On the other hand, the physical qualities of anticoagulated blood are also very different from those of cadaveric blood. Which, in turn, is very different from living blood."

**Pathological, acidic blood:** "But also the blood of the Man of the Shroud was pathological, due to the bleeding suffered, and its pH was acid, a consequence of asphyxiation, so its behavior is also very different from that of live blood and, allow me to say this, healthy."

**Chest wound wasn't a heterogenous mix:** "If this were not enough, from the wound on the side there was not only a cadaveric blood flow, but also post-mortem blood clots, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid (both following the scourging), and the fluid of pulmonary edema, due to asphyxiation. All these fluids are unlikely to come out mixed homogeneously. Most likely, they did it in a heterogeneous way. All this was not reproduced in the “experiment.”

**Dead bodies with deep wounds do bleed:** "The general public, and also many “experts”, believe that human corpses do not bleed. This is not true. When there are deep wounds, the cadavers have post-mortem hemorrhages, especially if moved, and the body of the Man of the Shroud was moved and manipulated, then bled profusely from his wounds and his natural orifices. And that blood was cadaveric blood, not living blood, not even chemically anticoagulated blood. "

## Shroud: Blood Pattern Analyses are not accurate and require new studies

Unknown Author.  https://shroud.com/pdfs/CIS%20reply.pdf

"Traces of soil were found on the image of the man of the Shroud. The skin of the man of the Shroud was that of a dehydrated man, under stress, who had been subject to beatings and repeated falls. Besides being swollen with bruises, it must have been encrusted with sweat, blood and dirt”. Once again, it was a state not comparable with that of a clean and smooth arm, or a plastic dummy. “"

## A Crucifixion Experiment to Assess Wrist and Forearm Blood Flows as Observed on the Shroud of Turin.  2019.

https://www.aafs.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/AAFS-2019-E73.pdf

Also reported in the journal Science:  https://www.science.org/content/article/researchers-hung-men-cross-and-added-blood-bid-prove-turin-shroud-real

"In this presentation, the forensic analysis is based on live suspensions on a cross with volunteer subjects, a methodology that was not used by Borrini and Garlaschelli to reach the conclusions."

"A recent paper reported by Borrini and Garlaschelli concluded from blood flow experiments that the observed wrist/forearm blood flow patterns on the Shroud of Turin are sufficiently inconsistent with the studies so that the Shroud of Turin should be considered to be a probable forgery.1 However, the conclusion of the scientific experiments and analyses of the same blood flows have reached the opposite conclusion."

But where can I see the actual presentation?  Jackson said it will be published in a forthcoming book.

Hugh Farey:  "As with the previous experiments, these demonstrations lacked rigour, were simplistic and superficial, added little to the non-authenticist case, and should probably have been almost completely ignored by those who believe the Shroud is authentic."  https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n88part5.pdf

## There is no mass spectrometry evidence that the C14 sample from the Shroud of Turin comes from a “medieval invisible mending”

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040603115003093

Bella, Marco, Luigi Garlaschelli, Roberto Samperi.  "There is no mass spectrometry evidence that the C14 sample from the Shroud of Turin comes from a “medieval invisible mending.”  Thermochemica Acta.  2015.

Downloaded locally.

**Says nobody proposed a late addition in that corner."** No one has hypothesized this before 1988 (before C14 analysis gave an “undesired” date for the linen); no textile experts who could examine the Shroud in person during the collection of the C14 sample reported any evidence of this late addition [cites the 1988 C14 paper in Nature]."

**Rogers doesn't give enough detail to reproduce vanillin detection:**  The author performs some qualitative chemical testing on these samples. He tests for the presence of vanillin, giving insufficient details to enable the reproduction of this analysis besides observing a change of color. He could not detect any vanillin on the main Shroud but apparently he could detect “some” vanillin in the Raes sample (sample c).

**Rogers says he found Pentosan** Rogers "analyzes the Raes sample (sample c) and C14 sample (sample b) with a microscope, supposedly identifying a pigment, alizarin, by means of its change of solubility by pH variations. His conclusion is “The presence of alizarin dye and red lakes in the Raes and radiocarbon samples indicates that the color has been manipulated. Specifically, the color and distribution of the coating implies that repairs were made at an unknown time with foreign linen dyed to match the older original material.” [1]. On the basis of solubility tests, Rogers hypothesizes the presence of pentosans rather than cellulose on the Raes samples (sample c)... He detects a signal at mass = 96 and could not detect the weak peak at mass = 126, concluding that the sample contains a significant amount of pentosan."

**Says it was an unknown hydrocarbon contaminant:**" No diagnostic peak in the pyrolysis mass spectra indicates a significant difference in the two samples, besides hydrocarbon-derived contamination. Therefore, none of the presented data supports the conclusion by Rogers."

### Gonella saying all but C14 test was excluded:

Marino writes:  "What happened next was thus described by Gonella: “For reasons that Cardinal Ballestrero and I were never able to understand, a deployment formed aiming at excluding any research that was not the radiocarbon dating”
